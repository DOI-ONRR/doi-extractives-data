# Germany Extractive Industries Data and Information

## What

Germany extracts natural resources such as oil, gas or building materials on its lands. This economic activity is a source of revenue for the country, the federal states (BundeslÃ¤nder) as well as for local municipalities.

This repository contains the code for http://www.rohstofftransparenz.de/en/, which is a website that includes both content information as well as visualized and raw data on the German extractive sector. The website provides a valuable resource for data and information analysis and visualizations that can be readily understood and accessed by the public for re-use through other media and applications. The repository contains a bilingual realization of the website and builds on the open source code from the U.S. EITI implementation.  

## Why

This effort is part of the German implementation of the international standard called the [Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)](https://eiti.org/). EITI is a global coalition of governments, companies and civil society working together to improve openness and accountable management of revenues from natural resources. For more information on the German process of implementing the EITI standard, see the [D-EITI homepage](https://www.d-eiti.de/en/).


Until Germany publishes its first EITI report in August 2017 the website http://www.rohstofftransparenz.de/en/ will constantly growing content and data wise.

## About this website
This is the development of the D-EITI report website, a fork of the [D-EITI homepage] (https://www.d-eiti.de/). Most of the source code was re-used and some was newly implemented, to see a journal of the technical challenges we faced performing this adaptation see [journal.md](https://github.com/PfeffermindGames/doi-extractives-data/blob/dev/journal.md).

## Data
The [data catalog](https://github.com/PfeffermindGames/doi-extractives-data/wiki/Data-Catalog) explains what most of the data is and where it came from. See the [data](data/) directory for more detailed info and instructions on updating the data.

## Running the Site
This site is made with [Jekyll]. To run it locally, clone this repository then:

1. Get [Jekyll] and the necessary dependencies: `bundle install`
1. Install all node dependencies: `npm install`
1. Set the $NODE_ENV to `dev`: `export NODE_ENV=dev`
1. Package js files with webpack: `webpack --watch`
1. Run the web server: `bundle exec jekyll serve` (or just `jekyll serve` if you have Jekyll installed globally)
1. Visit the local site at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

## Deployment
This site is deployed on [STRATO](https://www.strato.de/server/), and data is updated through an Admin panel that lives in a separate app
written in Node.js, you can see its source code at https://github.com/PfeffermindGames/resource-map-backend.

The site is build with `npm run prod:build`, and is served by a NGINX server.

## Styleguide
```sh
npm install --dev
npm run init-styleguide
cd styleguide-template && npm install
cd ..
npm run watch
```

## Code Style
We use [Hound CI](https://houndci.com/) to enforce SCSS and JavaScript
formatting conventions on new commits. You can run both of the linters with:

```sh
npm run lint
```

This runs both of the linters below in series.

#### JavaScript Linting
Hound uses [jshint](http://jshint.com/), which you can install as part of the
npm package's `devDependencies` with:

```sh
npm install --dev
```

Or you can install it globally with `npm i -g jshint`. Then, to lint the
JavaScript, run:

```sh
npm run lint-js
```

#### SCSS Linting
Hound uses [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint), which you can
install with `gem install scss_lint` if you haven't already run `bundle
install` to get Jekyll and its dependencies. To lint the SCSS files, run:

```sh
bundle exec scss-lint -c .scss-lint.yml
```

or simply:

```sh
npm run lint-scss
```
