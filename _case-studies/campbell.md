> Most of the coal consumed in the U.S. fuels the country’s electricity needs, and coal constitutes 39% of all electricity generated in the U.S.[^1] Wyoming leads domestic coal production, accounting for two-fifths of the nation’s output.[^2] More coal is extracted in Wyoming than in the next four largest-producing states combined, with nine of the nation’s ten largest mines located in the state.[^3] Campbell County, in the northeast corner of the state, supplies more coal for generating electricity than any other county in the nation.

## Geology and history

Campbell County’s geographic position atop the Powder River Basin came with such plentiful coal deposits that early cattle ranchers in the area could dig their own coal.[^4] Significant mining operations in the region began in the early twentieth century with the Peerless and Wyodak Mines near the city of Gillette. Further coal development and the discovery of oil spurred population growth in the county throughout the decades that followed.

Most Campbell County coal is sub-bituminous, meaning it contains 35% to 45% carbon. Although sub-bituminous coal has the second lowest energy content of the four main types of coal, it is often found in thick deposits near the surface, which results in lower mining costs.[^5] The low sulfur content of the coal in Campbell County deposits became an advantage in the market after the 1990 revision of the Clean Air Act, which required reduced sulfur emissions from coal-fired power plants.[^6] Today, the Powder River Basin is estimated to have 25 billion tons of economically recoverable coal resources.[^7]

## Production

In 2013, Campbell County produced 343 million tons of coal, accounting for 88% of the state’s total production.[^8] Wyoming coal mines operate largely on federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management under the U.S. Department of the Interior.[^9] In fact, Wyoming is the site of more coal mining on federal and Indian lands than any other state in the country, constituting 80% of the total coal production on federal and Indian lands in the fiscal year ending in 2014.[^10] [^11]

Production levels fluctuated between 2004 and 2013. For instance, 2013’s levels were 3% below 2004 production, partially due to lower natural gas prices that prompted some power companies to abandon coal use.[^12] Underground mining no longer exists in Campbell County, but 11 of Wyoming’s 17 open-pit coal mines are located in the county. The Peabody North Antelope Rochelle Mine and Arch Coal’s Black Thunder Mine, both in Campbell County, are the two largest coal mines in the U.S.

## Employment

The coal mining industry provides employment for 5,195 workers in Campbell County (out of a total population of 48,176), representing approximately 11% of county residents and 24% of total employment.[^13] The chart below shows the county employment trend in the broader mining industry from 2004 through 2013, including mining and mining-support activities.[^14]

## Revenue

With $120 million in total government revenue for 2014, Campbell County is the most revenue rich county in Wyoming.[^15] [^16] [^17] Its wealth is largely due to the revenue brought in from coal extraction. In 2013, Campbell County valued its own coal production at $3.5 billion.[^18] The State of Wyoming applies a 7% severance tax on the value of extracted surface coal.[^19] Between 2011 and 2012, Wyoming collected $587 million in severance tax revenue from coal production.[^20]

More than 90% of severance tax revenue goes to the state’s Severance Tax Distribution Account, which allocates 62% of its funding to the General Fund, 9% to cities and towns, 4% to counties, and the rest to various infrastructure development accounts.[^21] The state Mineral Revenue Report does not specify what percentage of this revenue was directed to Campbell County.

Campbell County further generates coal-related revenue through a gross products tax, which is an ad valorem property tax based on the taxable value of the coal produced the previous year. Campbell County bills and collects this tax directly, based on the applicable tax district {{ "mill levy" | term }}, and uses the revenue to fund local schools, infrastructure, and public services.[^22] In 2013, Campbell County collected $64.7 million from this and other property taxes, accounting for 70% of total tax revenue.[^23] 85% of property taxes for the fiscal year ending in 2013 came from natural-resource production taxes.[^24]

Local communities in Wyoming also benefit from federal mineral royalties and coal lease bonuses. Between 2011 and 2012, the state received $850 million in coal-related royalties and bonuses.[^25] This revenue helped fund public programs such as the state’s school foundation, highway fund, city budgets, and the University of Wyoming. The exact distribution formulas for these funds among the various public programs is outlined in the state’s Mineral Revenue Report.[^26]

## Costs

Campbell County and the Wyoming Department of Transportation (DOT) published the Campbell County Coal Belt Transportation Study in 2010.[^27] The report documents recommendations for roadway network improvements in the near and long term, discusses coal industry impacts to the system, and identifies funding options. While Campbell County is expected to be the primary funding source for new transportation improvements, the study includes a wide variety of collaborative funding efforts, including the Bureau of Land Management’s Abandoned Mine Lands program funds, road impact fees, a sinking fund account, and direct state and federal appropriations.[^28] The study estimates that it would require $43.9 million in investment in county roads between 2010 and 2015 to support coal extraction.[^29]

No publicly available government data discussing the emergency services, {{ "reclamation" | term }}, or water-infrastructure costs of coal mining in Campbell County was found.
