> For years, natural gas production in the Haynesville Shale in the southern U.S. was too difficult and costly. However, in the mid- to late-2000s, advances in {{ "hydraulic fracturing" | term }} and horizontal drilling techniques, as well as rising natural gas prices, made extracting natural gas in the region both technically feasible and profitable for the extractive industries.

## Geology and history

The Haynesville sedimentary rock formation rests 10,000 feet to 13,000 feet below the surface of northwestern Louisiana, eastern Texas, and southwestern Arkansas. DeSoto Parish, home to 27,112 residents, sits at the center of the Haynesville Shale. In the early 2000s, DeSoto Parish’s economy consisted primarily of cattle and dairy farming, and forest extraction. However, DeSoto’s economy transformed when the Chesapeake Energy Corporation drilled the first exploratory well in the Haynesville Shale in 2007, setting off a natural gas boom in the parish in 2008.[^1]

## Production

From 2007 to 2011, natural gas production quadrupled in northern Louisiana, where DeSoto Parish is located.[^2] More recently, declining natural gas prices have resulted in lower production numbers. In 2013, northern Louisiana produced a total of 1,858,222,187 thousand cubic feet (or Mcf) of natural gas.[^3]

In 2013, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated that there were 16.1 trillion cubic feet of {{ "proved reserves" | term }} in the Haneysville/Bossier Shale in Texas and Louisiana.[^4]

## Employment

Out of DeSoto’s nearly 28,000 residents, 548 people (about 2%) are employed in mining-support activities, which include oil and gas extraction.[^5] [^6] Of this group, 271 people are employed specifically in support activities for oil and gas extraction.[^7] Employment data for the complete oil and gas industry in the parish is unavailable. The chart below shows the increase in employment in broader extractive industries — specifically mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction — in DeSoto Parish between 2004 and 2013.[^8]

## Revenue

The Haynesville Shale natural gas boom has increased revenue for the State of Louisiana and DeSoto Parish through state severance taxes and royalties, parish property taxes, and sales and use taxes.

The State of Louisiana levies a severance tax on natural gas owners at a rate of $0.158 per Mcf (or thousand cubic feet) produced.[^9] In 2013, Louisiana received $99.45 million from gas severance taxes across the state, as well as $158.82 million from gas royalties for production on state-owned lands.[^10] [^11] The state distributes some of this revenue to the parishes where extraction took place. For severance taxes, one-fifth of taxes return to the parish, as long as the total does not exceed $750,000.[^12] For royalties, 10% return to the parish.[^13] In 2013, royalties, rents, and bonuses accounted for 2% of DeSoto Parish’s total revenue, while taxes made up 66%.[^14]

In addition to the state, DeSoto Parish also collects revenue from natural gas production, most notably in the form of property taxes. Revenue from property taxes increases with the assessed value of the property. Starting in 2008, the discovery of shale gas increased property values in DeSoto Parish, according to the parish school board. From FY 2008–2009 to FY 2012–2013, the taxable value of property within the parish increased by 125%, or from $291,745,028 to $655,148,947.[^15] [^16]

Natural gas exploration and development also spurred greater revenue from sales and use taxes (according to the parish school board), which increased from $8,068,875 in FY 2003–2004 to $73,086,778 in FY 2010–2011. This trend reversed in FY 2011–2012, when revenue from sales and use taxes decreased by 34.1%.[^17]

The DeSoto Parish School Board reports receiving the largest percentage of its annual revenue from sales and use taxes, which are deposited into the General Fund, School Lunch Fund, Debt Service Fund, and Capital Projects Fund.[^18] While sales and use taxes are not solely attributable to the natural gas industry, there is a noticeable decline in this revenue stream when the industry faces slowdowns. For example, sales and use taxes were expected to decline by $12.3 million (20.2%) in FY 2012–2013 compared to the prior fiscal year, as exploration for oil and natural gas moved to other parts of the country.[^19]

Property taxes also contribute substantially to the school board’s revenue, funding employee salaries, operations, and debt service payments on capital bonds for the local education system.[^20] The DeSoto Parish School Board estimated that 26.8% of the school budget would come from property taxes, and 49.1% would come from sales and use taxes in FY 2012–2013.[^21] State tax documents do not specify what percentage of property taxes comes from the gas industry.

## Costs

Since 2008, Louisiana has invested $1.1 billion in transportation projects in the seven parishes located in the northwest region of the state, including DeSoto Parish.[^22] While Louisiana’s latest comprehensive state transportation plan acknowledges that the state must pay adequate attention to the transportation needs of the rapidly expanding oil and gas industry, it does not specify the types or costs of projects supported.[^23]

Louisiana completed a Hydraulic Fracturing State Review in March 2011, which explains the state’s policies around industrial water use and wastewater reuse and/or disposal. However, the review does not itemize public expenditures on water-related infrastructure for industrial activities.[^24]

The DeSoto Parish Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Department formed in 2001, funded by a four percent {{ "millage tax" | term_end }}.[^25] Since then, the DeSoto EMS Department has worked closely with gas companies on safety measures, including answering numerous calls related to gas-well site incidents. The parish is not bearing the full burden of these incidents; the parish has received donations from private companies to offset equipment costs. The frequency and value of the donations is not published.
