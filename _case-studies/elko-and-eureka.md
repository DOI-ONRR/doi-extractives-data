> Gold is a precious mineral highly valued for its durability and beauty. Used to make jewelry and art, it also has technological uses, such as memory chip conductors and reflective satellite coverings. In 2013, the U.S. was the third-largest producer of gold, extracting 227 tons valued at $10.2 billion.[^1] The U.S. gold reserves, with an estimated size of 3,000 tons, are the fifth largest in the world.[^2] Nevada accounts for 74% of total U.S. gold production.[^3]

## Geology and history

Mineral mining in Nevada began shortly after the onset of the California Gold Rush in 1849. The 1859 discovery of the Comstock Lode silver deposit in the Virginia Range of western Nevada was the first major discovery of silver ore in the country.[^4] All told, the Great Basin geological region, which covers most of Nevada and crosses into Oregon, Utah, and California, has a total resource potential that exceeds 3,200 {{ "metric tons" | term:"metric ton"}} (100,000,000 ounces) of gold.[^5]

In 1962, Newmont Mining Corporation discovered large deposits of gold ore along the Carlin Trend, a mineral-rich belt stretching 40 miles across Elko and Eureka counties that soon became one of the largest gold-producing regions in the world. This discovery marked the beginning of a robust gold-mining industry in the region: As of 2012, 87% of Nevada’s total historical gold output had been generated since the Carlin Trend discovery.[^6]

## Production

Nevada is in the midst of the biggest gold boom in U.S. history, which began in 1981 and has produced over 240 million ounces, often from public lands. This surge in production is largely the result of discovering sediment-hosted deposits that contain microscopic gold particles.[^7] These deposits occur when gold is deposited quickly and disseminated into the surrounding rock.

The two major gold-mining companies driving this development are Newmont Mining Corporation and Barrick Gold Corporation, which operate both open-pit and underground mining operations.[^8] In 2012, gold production in Elko and Eureka counties totaled 2,474,623 ounces.[^9] In Eureka County, the top-producing mine was the Eastern Nevada Operations (Newmont), while the Meikle Mine (Goldstrike – Barrick Corporation) led production in Elko County.

## Employment

In these two counties, gold-mining operations employed approximately 10% of the total population in 2012, or 5,196 workers and 1,121 contractors within a two-county population of 52,957. Gold-mining employment represented 26% of total employment in the counties in 2012.[^10]

## Revenue

Gold mining is a key driver of funding for local governments across the state. In addition to various property and sales taxes, counties receive annual revenue from the gold industry, largely from the state’s Net Proceeds of Minerals Tax. This tax is considered to be an ad valorem property tax assessed on minerals produced in the state, applied at a rate of 5% on royalties and all other net proceeds exceeding $4 million. In 2012, Nevada counties received $117 million in revenue from the Net Proceeds of Minerals Tax.[^11] Of that, Elko and Eureka received $31 million to spend on public services and infrastructure.[^12]

## Costs

A number of state-level resources shed light on Elko and Eureka counties’ transportation systems, {{ "reclamation" | term }} procedures, and emergency services. While these government publications discuss costs to the state government, they do not specify the fiscal costs of gold extraction to Elko and Eureka county governments.
