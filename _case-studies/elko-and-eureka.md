description: Gold is a precious mineral highly valued for its durability and beauty. Used to make jewelry and art, it also has technological uses, such as memory chip conductors and reflective satellite coverings. In 2016, the U.S. was the fourth-largest producer of gold, extracting 209 tons valued at $8.5 billion. The U.S. gold reserves, with an estimated size of 3,000 tons, are the fourth largest in the world. Nevada accounts for 74% of total U.S. gold production.

> Gold is a precious mineral highly valued for its durability and beauty. Used to make jewelry and art, it also has technological uses, such as memory chip conductors and reflective satellite coverings. In 2016, the U.S. was the fourth-largest producer of gold, extracting 209 tons valued at $8.5 billion.[^1] The U.S. gold reserves, with an estimated size of 3,000 tons, are the fourth largest in the world.[^2] Nevada accounts for 74% of total U.S. gold production.[^3]

## Geology and history

Mineral mining in Nevada began shortly after the onset of the California Gold Rush in 1849. The 1859 discovery of the Comstock Lode silver deposit in the Virginia Range of western Nevada was the first major discovery of silver ore in the country.[^4] All told, the Great Basin geological region, which covers most of Nevada and crosses into Oregon, Utah, and California, has a total resource potential that exceeds 3,200 {{ "metric tons" | term:"metric ton"}} (100,000,000 ounces) of gold.[^5]

In 1962, Newmont Mining Corporation discovered large deposits of gold ore along the Carlin Trend, a mineral-rich belt stretching 40 miles across Elko and Eureka counties that soon became one of the largest gold-producing regions in the world. This discovery marked the beginning of a robust gold-mining industry in the region: As of 2014, 89% of Nevada’s total historical gold output had been generated since the Carlin Trend discovery.[^6]

## Production

Nevada is in the midst of the biggest gold boom in U.S. history, which began in 1981 and has produced over 240 million ounces, often from public lands. This surge in production is largely the result of discovering sediment-hosted deposits that contain microscopic gold particles.[^7] These deposits occur when gold is deposited quickly and disseminated into the surrounding rock.

The two major gold-mining companies driving this development are Newmont Mining Corporation and Barrick Gold Corporation, which operate both open-pit and underground mining operations.[^8] In 2015, gold production in Elko and Eureka counties totaled 2,145,932 ounces.[^9] In Eureka County, the top-producing mine was the Eastern Nevada Operations (Newmont), while the Meikle Mine (Goldstrike – Barrick Corporation) led production in Elko County.

### Gold production in Elko and Eureka counties[^10]

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/img/counties/nv-production.svg" alt="Chart shows gold production in Elko and Eureka counties from 2008 to 2015. The y-axis represents ounces of gold produced, and tops out at 3.5 million. Annual gold production was just under 3.5 million ounces in 2008, then declined annually to its 2014 level of just over 2 million ounces before rebounding slightly in 2015. Gold production in Elko County was between 500,000 and 800,000 ounces each year, and production in Eureka County was between 1.4 and 2.8 million ounces each year." class="case_studies_content-graph">


## Employment

In these two counties, gold-mining operations employed approximately 9.5% of the total population in 2015, or 4,388 workers and 676 contractors within a two-county population of 53,231.[^11] [^12] Gold-mining employment represented 22.9% of total employment in Elko and Eureka counties in 2015.[^13]

### Mining industry employment in Elko and Eureka counties[^14]

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/img/counties/nv-employment.svg" alt="Chart shows employment in the gold mining industry in Elko and Eureka counties from 2006 to 2015. The y-axis represents numbers of jobs, and tops out at 9,000. The total number of jobs in gold mining in these two counties rose steadily from around 4,500 in 2006 to nearly 8,000 in 2014 before falling to just over 5,000 in 2015." class="case_studies_content-graph">


## Revenue

Gold mining is a key funding source for local governments across the state. In addition to various property and sales taxes, counties receive annual revenue from the gold industry, largely from the state’s Net Proceeds of Minerals Tax. This tax is considered to be an ad valorem property tax assessed on minerals produced in the state, applied at a rate of 5% on royalties and all other net proceeds exceeding $4 million. Elko and Eureka counties accounted for a total of 33.35% of the state’s Net Proceeds of Minerals (5.58% and 27.77% respectively) in 2015. That year, Nevada counties received a total of $102 million in state and county Net Proceeds of Minerals Taxes. $50.5 million went to the state and $51.1 million went directly to counties.[^15]

In FY 2016, Elko County received $2.7 million in Royalties and Net Proceeds of Minerals Tax. Of that, $2.7 million (91%) came from gold mines, which accounts for 5% of the county's total revenue ($50.6 million)[^16] [^17] In the same period, Eureka County received $9.3 million in Royalties and Net Proceeds of Minerals tax, of which 99% came from gold mines.[^18] Net proceeds from gold accounted for 51% of Eureka County’s total revenue ($18 million).[^19]

Eureka County distributed that money to multiple funds. Eureka County’s general fund received $1.2 million in Net Proceeds of Minerals tax in 2016, down from $3.9 million in 2015, and the Eureka County Road Fund received $252,509, down from $817,282. The Regional Transportation Fund and the Future Reserve Fund, on the other hand, received $68,866 and $22,956, respectively, after having received no mineral tax revenue the previous year.[^20]

## Costs

A number of state-level resources shed light on Elko and Eureka counties’ transportation systems, {{ "reclamation" | term }} procedures, and emergency services. While these government publications discuss costs to the state government, they do not specify the fiscal costs of gold extraction to Elko and Eureka county governments.
