> Kern County is situated in the southernmost region of the San Joaquin Valley, in California’s interior. While Kern County has significant deposits of many resources — including natural gas, geothermal steam, wind, gold, and other minerals — oil in particular has shaped Kern County’s local economy for over a century.

## Geology and history

Companies began extracting oil at a commercial level in California in the 1850s, inspired by the oil rush in Pennsylvania and a growing market for oil-fueled lighting. In the 1860s, production began in Kern County, where extractors dug holes into oil seeps to remove the fuel. Near the turn of the century, extraction in the county shifted toward commercial drilling, in part because of the 1890 discovery of the Midway-Sunset field, which is still the largest-producing oil field in California today.[^1]

During the beginning of the twentieth century, many other large oil discoveries occurred in Kern County, and continued at a lesser pace through the 1970s. As discoveries of new fields ended in the 1970s, refined steam-injection techniques helped producers extract the substantial heavy oil — a more difficult and costly type of oil to extract and transport — from known Kern County fields.[^2]

## Production

In terms of oil production, Kern County has long been a leader both nationally and within California. California is one of the top oil producing states in the U.S., producing more than 6% of total production in 2014.[^3] The largest-producing region in California is the San Joaquin basin, which contains Kern County. Since peaking in 1985, California’s oil production has trended downward; Kern County is no exception to this trend. However, production has rebounded slightly over the past several years, increasing from 141 million {{ "oil barrels" | term:"barrel" }} (bbls) in 2013 to 144 million bbls in 2015.[^4]

In 2013, the largest field in California in terms of proven reserves was Belridge South Field in Kern County, with estimated 2013 production of 23.7 million bbls.[^5] Belridge South ranked ninth among the top 100 oil fields in the country.[^6] Four of the five largest oil fields in California are found in Kern County: Belridge South, Midway-Sunset, Kern River, and Elk Hills.[^7]

## Employment

In 2014, oil and gas extraction employed over 11,500 of Kern County’s 874,589 residents, up from just over 10,000 in 2013.[^8] This is close to 1.3% of the population and 4.5% of total employment.[^9] In particular, 3,243 people were employed in oil and gas extraction, and 8,321 in support activities (1,863 in drilling for oil and gas, and 6,485 in support activities for oil and gas operations).[^10] This represents a slight dip in extraction-related employment and a minor increase in employment in support activities from 2013.

## Revenue

California does not levy a statewide severance tax on oil and gas production, but counties in the state collect ad valorem or property taxes on oil and gas resources and equipment owned in their jurisdictions. The state does levy an annual assessment on oil and gas production to fund the Department of Conservation’s Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources Division. The division oversees the drilling, operation, maintenance, and plugging and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells.[^11]

Like other counties in the state, Kern County collects property taxes for oil and gas properties, the total amount of which fluctuates with changes in the price of these resources over time. Between 2012 and 2015, the assessed property value of oil and gas properties has decreased from 35.4% to 32.2% of countywide assessed property values.[^12] In 2014, property tax revenues from oil and gas properties were approximately $60 million, or 15% of the county’s discretionary revenue.[^13]

Kern County also collects oil and gas royalties. Compared to property tax revenue, however, oil and gas royalties comprise a small portion of county funds. Oil and gas royalty revenues have increased steadily from $123,211 in FY2009-2010 to $628,381 in FY 2013-2014.[^14]

According to the Kern County Treasurer-Tax Collector, the top two payers of property taxes in the county in FY 2015–2016 were Chevron Corporation and California Resources Elk Hills LLC.[^15] The companies received bills for over 10.8% of the total property taxes due to the county. All of the top ten property tax payers were associated with either the extractive or energy sectors, and received combined bills for over $209 million, or 33.28% of total property taxes due to the county.[^16]

## Costs

A number of resources shed light on Kern County’s transportation systems, water infrastructure, {{ "reclamation" | term }} procedures, and emergency services. However, these government publications do not explicitly discuss the fiscal costs of oil extraction to the Kern County government.
