Iron ore is the primary mineral substance for the world’s iron and steel industries. Michigan is the second-largest producer of iron ore in the country behind Minnesota. All of Michigan’s iron-production operations are located in the northern reaches of the state, in Marquette County.

Marquette County generated 20% of the national iron output in 2012.[^1] This iron ore is located in the Marquette Iron Range, a narrow basin of iron formations running approximately 33 miles through the towns of Negaunee and Ishpeming. Discovered in 1844, this range houses Michigan’s oldest iron-mining operations; the Jackson Mining Company began extraction here in 1848. In the following decades, the development of critical infrastructure — including roads, railroads, and a canal connecting Lake Superior and Lake Huron — spurred additional mining activity. It was iron mining that originally drew settlers to the area.

Although increased production costs and a diversified global supply of iron drove down output in the first half of the twentieth century, the development of new technology in the 1950s made it economically feasible to produce lower-grade taconite, which increased output.[^2]

<h2 class="h3"><a name="production" class="case_studies_content-heading" data-nav-header="production">Production</a></h2>

Today’s iron mining along the Marquette Iron Range is centered on the Empire and Tilden Mines, operated by Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. In 2012, these two mines generated a combined 10.8 million {{ "metric tons" | term:"metric ton" }} of usable iron ore, which produced a total of 6.6 million metric tons of iron.[^3] Marquette County’s usable iron ore output had remained relatively constant over the preceding ten years, averaging 12 million metric tons out of a total annual capacity of 13 million metric tons.[^4] As shown in the chart below, the 2009 economic crisis drove down iron-ore production, but it rebounded the following year.

Major corporate landowners own a significant portion of the land used for natural resource extraction in Marquette County; lands in public ownership make up only 25% of the county.[^5]

<h2 class="h3"><a name="employment" class="case_studies_content-heading" data-nav-header="employment">Employment</a></h2>

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), total private sector employment in Marquette County stood at 27,195 in 2012.[^6] The iron-mining industry employed 1,500 individuals (6% of total employment). Iron-ore reserve estimates project a thirty-year supply at Tilden Mine, suggesting continued employment opportunities for the near future.[^7] Empire Mine production, on the other hand, was slated to halt in 2014 until a partnership agreement with ArcelorMittal USA Inc. extended the mine’s operations (and employment potential) through 2016.[^8]

<h2 class="h3"><a name="revenue" class="case_studies_content-heading" data-nav-header="revenue">Revenue</a></h2>

The State of Michigan assesses mining operations under the same state and local taxes as other commercial ventures in the state (for example, sales, use, and property taxes). However, the state does collect a specific tax on low-grade iron ore at a rate of 1.1% of the value per gross ton produced.[^9] In 2013, Marquette County collected $3,049,250 from that tax, comprising 12.8% of the total $23,834,433 General Fund operating budget for that year.[^10] The low-grade iron ore tax revenue constituted an increase of $767,000 from 2012.[^11] These funds supported public services, such as law enforcement, health care, childcare, aging services, and the county’s international airport.[^12]
