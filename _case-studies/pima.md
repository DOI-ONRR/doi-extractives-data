> Copper is a major industrial metal used in construction, electronics, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer products. In 2012, the U.S. was the world’s fourth-largest copper producer, mining 1.15 million tons of copper worth approximately $9 billion.[^1] Of the five major copper-producing states (Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, and Montana), Arizona was the most productive in 2011; its copper output totaled 751,000 {{ "metric tons" | term_end:"metric ton" }}, representing 68% of the national total.[^2] Greenlee and Pima counties generated the majority of that production.

## Geology and history

In Pima County, much like nearby Greenlee County, copper mining began in the 1870s. Mining activity in Pima County flourished in the late nineteeth century, particularly as the arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad brought increased commerce and traffic to the region. The copper-mining industry followed a series of boom-and-bust cycles throughout the following decades, with particular spikes during the two world wars, when demand soared. Today, copper output in Pima County is driven by operations at three open-pit mines: Sierrita, Mission Complex, and Silver Bell.

## Production

In 2012, the combined copper production from Pima County’s three major mines totaled 152,700 metric tons.[^3] [^4] [^5] This output constituted 13% of national production for that year.[^6] Freeport-McMoRan Inc. manages the Sierrita mine, the top-producing operation in the county, while ASARCO LLC owns both the Mission Complex and Silver Bell mines.[^7]

## Employment

Copper mining makes up a relatively small portion of Pima County’s overall employment, largely as a result of the Tucson metropolitan area’s more diversified economy and workforce. Of Pima County’s total 2012 employment of 346,828, copper mining and related activities account for less than 1% (1,745 workers).[^8] The county cites a 58% growth in employment in this sector compared to 2004 levels.[^9] Data for mining and support activities for the entire mining industry shows an overall increase in employment in Pima County from 2004 through 2013.[^10] [^11]

## Revenue

State revenue from copper extraction is directed back to Pima County primarily through the state’s severance tax. Arizona levies this tax on metal minerals (including copper) set at 2.5% on 50% of the difference between the gross value of production and the production costs. While 47.6% of this revenue goes to the state’s General Fund, the other 52.4% is distributed to cities and counties.[^12] In 2013, $21 million was distributed to all cities and counties in Arizona from the severance tax on metals.[^13] Arizona also collects a Transaction Privilege Tax, although this tax does not apply to copper revenue.[^14]

Pima County derives revenue from copper mining within its borders. However, in order to protect individual mines’ sales information, the state does not disclose what percentage of the $21 million distributed to all cities and counties in Arizona from severance taxes goes to Pima County. In 2012, Pima County also collected more than $3 million in property taxes from the Phelps Dodge Corporation (now Freeport-McMoRan Inc.) and ASARCO LLC, the two largest copper-mining companies in the county.[^15] These two corporations, which operate the three largest mines in Pima County, are the second- and third-largest property tax payers in Pima County, respectively. These funds are channeled toward public services such as infrastructure development, public safety, and local schools.

ASARCO LLC also pays royalties to both the State of Arizona and the Tohono O’odham Nation as part of the leasing agreement to operate the Mission Mine, which is located on both state-owned and Indian land.
