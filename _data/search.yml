In the early years, the Abandoned Mine Lands program focused on the physical reclamation of hazards affecting coalfield communities. More recently, the Program began working to reclaim the vitality of communities left impoverished and degraded by past coal mining. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act balances the need to protect the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining with the Nation's need for coal as an essential energy source. It ensures that coal mining operations are conducted in an environmentally responsible manner and that the land is adequately reclaimed during and following the mining process."

  description: "This memorandum transmits the results of the OIG’s final evaluation report on oil and gas leasing in Indian Country. The review concluded that Indian oil and gas leasing is not achieving its full economic potential. Numerous problems contribute to a general industry preference to conduct business on private, Federal, and state lands before considering Indian lands. Indian landowner frustration with some of these conditions has led to legal action against BIA. The OIG found, however, that improving Federal oversight could help stimulate oil and gas development on Indian lands."
