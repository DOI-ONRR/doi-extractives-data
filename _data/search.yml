  description: "This site links to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement's (OSMRE) major programs: one, Reclaiming Abandoned Mine Lands – Restoring the Environment, Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act; and two, Regulating Coal Mines – Protecting the Environment, Title V of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. In the early years, the Abandoned Mine Lands program focused on the physical reclamation of hazards affecting coalfield communities. More recently, the Program began working to reclaim the vitality of communities left impoverished and degraded by past coal mining. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act balances the need to protect the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining with the Nation's need for coal as an essential energy source. It ensures that coal mining operations are conducted in an environmentally responsible manner and that the land is adequately reclaimed during and following the mining process."
