- term: "data accounting"
  definition: "This data is summarized based on accounting date (which is the date the revenue was reported to and accepted into ONRR’s financial system). Since companies can adjust and correct data up to seven years after a transaction takes place, this accounting year data includes corrections for sales that took place in previous years. This type of data is therefore most useful when analyzing dollars ONRR collected and disbursed in a given year."

Many of the companies that fall below this threshold are individuals and family trusts. Payments made by companies that reported less than $100,000 are aggregated (rolled up) into this category."

- term: "one mine one product"
  definition: "Disclosing payments of solid mineral companies who only produce and sell one product from one mine can reveal proprietary sales price and contracting information, and cause competitive harm to small companies. The Department of the Interior is legally obligated through the Trades Secrets Act to safeguard this data, so payments from these companies are aggregated (rolled up) in this category. These aggregated payments make up less than three thousandths of one percent of all payments."
