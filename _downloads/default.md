    <a href="http://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm" class="link-no_under"><h3 id="gdp">Gross domestic product (GDP)</h3></a>
    <p>This data is from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a> (BEA), which measures GDP by adding up the “real value added” for each industry that contributes to the U.S. economy. According to the BEA, real value added includes “compensation of employees; taxes on production and imports, less subsidies; and gross operating surplus.”</p>
    <p>The data we use for the interactions on this site is a subset of the data available on their website. We access this data live via an Application Programming Interface (API).

    <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm" class="link-no_under"><h3 id="jobs">Jobs</h3></a>
    <p>We use two types of jobs data on this site. One is <em>wage and salary</em> data, which describes the number of people (full-time and part-time) employed in natural resource extraction that receive wages or salaries from companies. This data is from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, specifically the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.</p>
    <p>We've grouped this data according to the following <a href="https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart_code=21&search=2016%20NAICS%20Search">North American Industry Classification System</a> (NAICS) codes:</p>

    <p>The best way to get this data is from <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm">this page</a> and to download CSVs single files annual averages (you will need to load titles). We also have <a href="https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/wiki/Data-Catalog#salary-employment">notes on using this data</a> from our web development team.</p>
    <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm">Go to BLS quarterly census &#8594;
    </a>

    <p class="u-margin-top">The other type of jobs data we use is <em>self-employment</em>. This data describes the number of people (full-time and part-time) that are self-employed in natural resource extraction. Self-employed people don’t receive wages or salaries because they own their company, either as a sole proprietor, partnership, or small business. This data includes some double counting because people may appear on multiple tax forms.</p>
    <p>Self-employment data comes from comes from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>, or BEA, but must be calculated, by subtracting SA27N Full- and Part-Time Wage and Salary Employment by {{ "NAICS" | term:"north american industry classification system (naics)" }} Industry from SA25N Full- and Part-Time Employment by NAICS Industry. We also have <a href="https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/wiki/Data-Catalog#self-employment">notes on using this data</a> from our web development team.</p>
