    <p>Countries implementing the EITI Standard publish reports that disclose the revenues and other information from extraction of the country’s natural resources. Companies report payments to the government (e.g., rents, taxes, royalties) and the government reports what it received. These figures are compiled and reconciled by an independent administrator and published. The 2015 USEITI reconciliation is at the link below.</p>

    <p>This data is from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a> (BEA), which measures GDP by adding up the “real value added” for each industry that contributes to the U.S. economy. According to the BEA, real value added includes “compensation of employees; taxes on production and imports, less subsidies; and gross operating surplus.”</p>
    <p>The data we use for the interactions on this site is a subset of the data available on their website. We access this data live via an Application Programming Interface (API).

    <p>We use two types of jobs data on this site. One is <em>wage and salary</em> data, which describes the number of people (full-time and part-time) employed in natural resource extraction that receive wages or salaries from companies. This data is from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, specifically the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.</p>
    <p>We've grouped this data according to the following <a href="https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart_code=21&search=2016%20NAICS%20Search">North American Industry Classification System</a> (NAICS) codes:</p>

    </a>

    <p class="u-margin-top">The other type of jobs data we use is <em>self-employment</em>. This data describes the number of people (full-time and part-time) that are self-employed in natural resource extraction. Self-employed people don’t receive wages or salaries because they own their company, either as a sole proprietor, partnership, or small business. This data includes some double counting because people may appear on multiple tax forms.</p>
    <p>Self-employment data comes from comes from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>, or BEA, but must be calculated, by subtracting SA27N Full- and Part-Time Wage and Salary Employment by {{ "NAICS" | term:"north american industry classification system (naics)" }} Industry from SA25N Full- and Part-Time Employment by NAICS Industry. We also have <a href="https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/wiki/Data-Catalog#self-employment">notes on using this data</a> from our web development team.</p>
