    <p class="case_studies_intro-para">We use many government datasets on this site to power our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/explore/">interactive visualizations</a>. Some of these were created through the USEITI process, and are available here for download. Others come from other government sources. For those, we provide links direct to the source here so you can find fresh data whenever you need it.</p>

        <p>Countries implementing the EITI Standard publish reports that disclose the revenues and other information from extraction of the country’s natural resources. Companies report payments to the government (e.g., rents, taxes, royalties) and the government reports what it received. These figures are compiled and reconciled by an independent administrator and published. The 2015 USEITI reconciliation is at the link below.</p>

        <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm" id="jobs" class="link-no_under"><h3>Jobs</h3></a>
        <p>We use two types of jobs data on this site. One is <em>Wage and Salary</em> data, which describes the number of people (full-time and part-time) employed in natural resource extraction that receive wages or salaries from companies. This data is from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, specifically the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. The best way to get this data is from <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm">this page</a> and to download CSVs single files annual averages (you will need to load titles). We also have <a href="https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/wiki/Data-Catalog#salary-employment">notes on using this data</a> from our web development team.</p>

        </a>

        <p class="u-margin-top">The other type of jobs data we use is <em>Self-Employment</em>. This data describes the number of people (full-time and part-time) that are self-employed in natural resource extraction. Self-employed people don’t receive wages or salaries because they own their company, either as a sole proprietor, partnership, or small business. This data comes from comes from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>, or BEA, but must be calculated, by subtracting SA27N Full- and Part-Time Wage and Salary Employment by <span class="term term-p" data-term="north american industry classification system (naics)" title="Click to define" tabindex="0">NAICS<i class="icon-book"></i></span> Industry from SA25N Full- and Part-Time Employment by NAICS Industry.
