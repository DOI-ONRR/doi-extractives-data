    <h1>Corporate Income Tax</h1>

    <p class="case_studies_intro-para">Due to U.S. law, information about companies’ individual income tax payments is confidential. However, there are two key sources of publicly available information about federal income taxes for the extractive industries: the government and the filings of companies that are publicly listed.</p>

    <h3>Tax information from government sources</h3>

    <p>As mandated by the <a href="http://legisworks.org/sal/39/stats/STATUTE-39-Pg756.pdf">Revenue Act of 1916</a>, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) publishes statistics related to “the operations of the internal revenue laws” as they affect individuals, corporations, and other entities. The IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Statistics-of-Income">Statistics of Income</a> (SOI) program is responsible for executing this function by collecting, processing, and presenting this data, and then sharing information about how the tax system works with other government agencies and the general public.</p>

    <p>SOI publishes data on <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/Tax-Stats-2">tax statistics</a> and <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Corporation-Tax-Statistics">corporation tax statistics</a>.  SOI aggregates tax data separately for <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-S-Corporation-Statistics">S-corporations</a>.</p>

    <p>SOI presents the data in various ways for corporations, including by size, type of return, and sector or industry. The data by sector or industry is aggregated by <span class="term term-p" data-term="NAICS" title="Click to define" tabindex="0">NAICS<i class="icon-book"></i></span> industrial sectors, and then further by major and minor industry classifications. The total federal income tax liability reported by industry should be interpreted with care because industry classification of companies with multiple lines of business are classified into an industry category based on the taxpayer’s determination of the business activity from which it derives the highest percentage of its total receipts.</p>

    <h4>Corporate income tax receipts</h4>

    <p>SOI’s calculations of federal corporate income tax receipts from all returns in the mining and petroleum refining sectors for <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/SOI-Tax-Stats-Returns-of-Active-Corporations-Table-1">tax years 2009 to 2013</a> are presented below.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

    <h3>Tax information from company filings</h3>

    <p>Publicly listed companies are required to report tax information in a variety of ways in their annual financial statement filings, including on their statements of cash flows, income statements, and balance sheets. Depending on the geographic scope of a company’s activities, it may be subject to income taxes at the federal, state, local, or foreign levels, which are generally reported as a single aggregate sum of the various types of tax paid during a financial reporting period.</p>

    <p>Companies that are not publicly listed are generally not required to publish any of these tax disclosures.</p>

    <p>In 2010, the United States enacted the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/how-it-works/federal-reforms/#dodd-frank">Dodd-Frank Act</a>, which requires listed extractive companies to separately disclose information about payments to governments around the world, including their federal corporate income tax payments. The Securities and Exchange Commission is rewriting the rule and has stated that it will be proposed in the spring of 2016. Once finalized, publicly traded companies will report according to the law and the rule.</p>
