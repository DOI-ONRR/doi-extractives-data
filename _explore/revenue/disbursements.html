    <h1>Disbursements</h1>

    <p class="case_studies_intro-para">Once collected, the federal government distributes revenue from natural resource extraction for public use in a variety of ways.</p>

    <p>Federal corporate income taxes go to the General Fund of the Treasury, and Congress determines how to allocate these resources each year through the appropriations process.</p>

    <p>Other revenue from extraction on federal lands goes to many different funds and entities. In fiscal year (FY) 2013, ONRR disbursed $14.187 billion in DOI revenue. The recipient of these funds depends on whether the revenue is from onshore or offshore extraction.</p>
