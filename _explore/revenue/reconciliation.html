      <h1>Reconciliation</h1>

      <p>During the USEITI process, companies report payments to the government (such as rents, taxes, and royalties), and those reports are compared with government records of revenue received.</p>

      <p>The 2015 report looked at calendar year data for 2013. The independent administrator identified and investigated 17 <span class="term term-p" data-term="material variance" title="Click to define" tabindex="0">material variances<i class="icon-book"></i></span>.</p>

      <p>The 45 companies invited to participate are listed here, along with reported payments and reconciliation results for each revenue type.</p>
