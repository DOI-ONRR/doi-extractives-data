> Data about revenue from the extractive industries is subject to a number of controls, standards, and regulations in the United States. Companies and governments are accountable to internal and external oversight that ensures correct reporting and publication of payments.

## Tracking and verifying company payments to government agencies in the U.S. extractive industries

Companies and government agencies are each legally responsible for reporting accurate, verifiable payment data. Controls and standards help companies report correct data on the first attempt, and reports are verified after submission. Independent audits of financial statements, transactions, and systems also help ensure compliance with internal and external standards.

### Company standards and oversight

* The [American Institute of CPAs](http://www.aicpa.org/Pages/default.aspx) publishes [Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (PDF)](http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/AuditAttest/DownloadableDocuments/AU-00150.pdf).
* The [Financial Accounting Standards Board](http://www.fasb.org/jsp/FASB/Page/LandingPage&cid=1175805317350) Accounting Standards Codification is the single official source of authoritative, nongovernmental U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
* The [Public Company Accounting Oversight Board](https://pcaobus.org/Pages/default.aspx) helps confirm that registered public accounting firms are operating in accordance with auditing standards.
* The [Security and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/) maintains a searchable database of filings by public companies, called [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html).

### Federal standards and audits

- [OMB Circular No. A-123](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/circulars_a123_rev) prescribes responsibilities for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls and financial management systems.
- The roles and responsibilities of each agency are governed by the [The Chief Financial Officers Act: A Mandate for Federal Financial Management Reform (PDF)](http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/af12194.pdf).
- The [Government Accountability Office](http://www.gao.gov/) (GAO) publishes _Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government_, also known as the [Green Book](http://www.gao.gov/greenbook/overview).
- Audits are supported by standards like the GAO's _Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards_, also known as the [Yellow Book](http://www.gao.gov/yellowbook/overview).[^6]
- The [U.S. Standard General Ledger](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/ussgl/ussgl_home.htm) provides a uniform chart of accounts and technical guidance for standardizing federal agency accounting to OMB and the U.S. Treasury.
- Government audit results, like the [Independent Auditors' Report on the U.S. Department of the Interior Financial Statements for Fiscal Years 2015 and 2014](https://www.doioig.gov/reports/independent-auditors-report-us-department-interior-financial-statements-fiscal-years-2015) and [GAO Financial Audit: U.S. Government's Fiscal Years 2015 and 2014 Consolidated Financial Statements](http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-357R), are publicly disclosed on an annual basis.

The U.S. government is subject to numerous laws governing data publication, including:
