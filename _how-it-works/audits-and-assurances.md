> Data about revenue from the extractive industries is subject to a number of controls, standards, and regulations in the United States. Companies and governments are accountable to internal and external oversight that ensures correct reporting and publication of payments.

## Tracking and verifying company payments to government agencies in the U.S. extractive industries

Companies and government agencies are each legally responsible for reporting accurate, verifiable payment data. Controls and standards help companies report correct data on the first attempt, and reports are verified after submission. Independent audits of financial statements, transactions, and systems also help ensure compliance with internal and external standards.
