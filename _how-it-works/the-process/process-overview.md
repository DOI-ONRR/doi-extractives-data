	  <h1>Process Overview</h1>

	  <p>U.S. citizens, corporations, and public bodies, such as municipalities, can apply to the federal government for rights to extract natural resources from federal lands. The 2015 USEITI Report focuses on companies, the largest revenue contributors. Unlike other countries with significant extractive industries, the U.S. government does not own oil, gas, renewable energy, or mining companies.</p>

	  <p>In awarding rights to companies to extract natural resources from federal lands, the federal government balances competing policy goals and interests, and adheres to and enforces regulations. For the right to extract natural resources from federal lands that are owned by U.S. citizens, companies pay the federal government revenue.</p>

	  <p>There are five main phases in the process:</p>

					<p>BLM and BOEM make long-term plans to identify which federal lands to open for natural resource extraction. BLM and BOEM operate within the laws set by Congress, which specify land uses.</p>

					<p>BLM and BOEM balance energy and economic needs with environmental, community, and other considerations. BLM’s <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/coal_and_non-energy.html">multiple-use planning process for coal extraction</a> and BOEM’s <a href="http://www.boem.gov/five-year-program/">Five-Year Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program</a> are examples of how the federal government weighs different public interests.</p>

					<p>At this stage, the federal government must often prepare a programmatic EIS in line with the National Environmental Policy Act to estimate the impact of the natural resource extraction program on the environment, and alternatives to the proposed action. The public has many opportunities to engage with and comment on environmental and regulatory reviews.</p>

					<p>In addition to engaging with environmental and regulatory reviews, the public can participate in and inform how natural resources result in DOI revenue by engaging locally with BLM, BOEM, and intergovernmental natural resource task forces. For example, BOEM regularly holds <a href="http://www.boem.gov/About-BOEM/BOEM-Regions/Alaska-Region/Community-Liaison/index.aspx">community meetings and public hearings in Alaska</a>.</p>

					<p>Before offering federal onshore lands for leasing, the Secretary of the Interior may provide 45 days of notice to the public, including a 30-day period to receive public comments after the announcement. The Secretary of the Interior may also provide <a href="http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40806.pdf">opportunities for the public to participate</a> in developing the resource management plans that determine which federal lands will be leased. These opportunities can include public hearings and community meetings that inform and direct how potential extraction activities will affect community life. In the past, public engagement has helped <a href="http://ostseis.anl.gov/involve/index.cfm">determine the scope of extraction projects and raised environmental issues and alternatives</a> that were not fully addressed by  government proposals.</p>

	            <p>The federal government, specifically BLM for onshore lands and BOEM for offshore lands, sells the rights to apply to explore for, develop, and extract natural resources on federal lands. This sale of rights is called a lease. In the case of mining hardrock minerals, applicants pay a set fee to stake a claim rather than bid on a lease.</p>

				<p>Leases and claims do not last forever. For example, a lease could last for 10 or 40 years, during which time the lease holder must demonstrate progress in extracting natural resources. When leases and claims expire, the rights return to the federal government.</p>

	            <p>The laws and statutes that govern natural resource extraction in the U.S. have created safeguards in the leasing process to protect the public’s interest. For example, all oil and gas leases, both onshore and offshore, as well as almost all coal leases, go through a competitive leasing process. A competitive leasing process is open to interested bidders, and multiple parties can bid on and compete for a single lease. The government awards the lease to the highest bidder, so long as that bidder meets its requirements (for example, the bidder for a federal coal lease cannot hold an existing federal coal lease for more than 10 years that has not produced commercial quantities of coal). Leasing for fossil fuels becomes noncompetitive when only one party bids on an oil and gas lease or when a parcel of land for coal leasing is surrounded by a company’s existing mining operation.</p>

				<p>As an additional safeguard to get the public a fair price, the federal government cannot accept any bid (even if there is only one bid) for an oil, gas, or coal lease if it does not meet or exceed the fair market value. The fair market value is the fair price that the federal government’s analysis shows an applicant would bid given the geological resources in the land. The measure of the land’s fair market value is based on the federal government's estimate of the price the land would sell for in a competitive market. For offshore lands, BOEM conducts the fair market value analysis after opening each sealed bid to make sure the apparent winner’s bid is high enough. BOEM looks for evidence of market competition and estimates the tract value. For onshore lands, BLM estimates the fair market value prior to a lease sale. Different state offices use different approaches, including using recent comparable sales and estimating the future value of the natural resources in question. After BLM has determined the fair market value, the bureau conducts live auctions for leases.</p>

				<p>In both the competitive and noncompetitive leasing processes, either BLM (for onshore resources) or ONRR (for offshore resources) collects the bid from the winning company, called a bonus payment, and the first year’s rent.</p>

	          <div class="accordion-content">
	            <p>The lease holder must obtain licenses and permits from federal, state, and local, and potentially tribal agencies to explore for natural resources. Exploration is the process of discovering the specific location, quantity, and quality of natural resources on claimed or leased lands. Exploration typically takes place after the lease is secured, but in some instances, exploration by multiple parties is permitted before the lease is sold to <a href="http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Programs/minerals/Coal.html#Coal_Exploration_Licenses">increase competition in the bidding process</a>.</p>

				<p>To apply for a permit, companies must submit an exploration plan detailing all planned exploration activities, including timing, location, method, and potential environmental impact. For onshore lands, BLM evaluates exploration plans and issues exploration permits to companies. For offshore lands, BOEM evaluates exploration plans and BSEE issues permits.</p>

				<p>The process varies between natural resources, but most exploration requires extensive geological expertise and technical capacity. Companies use many exploration techniques, including magnetic surveying, seismic mapping, sample analysis, and drilling exploratory wells.</p>

				<p>Exploration is more difficult and expensive offshore than onshore; as a result, the exploration phase for offshore natural resources usually takes longer than for onshore natural resources. For example, an onshore permit to drill for oil and gas expires <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/oil_and_gas/best_management_practices/gold_book.html">after two years</a>; the exploration period for offshore oil and gas leases <a href="http://www.boem.gov/Resource-Evaluation-Glossary/">ranges from five to ten years</a> depending on the depth of water and the presence of adverse conditions such as hazardous weather.</p>

				<p>During this phase, companies pay annual rent set in the lease terms on the claimed or leased lands to the federal government, which is collected by ONRR or BLM.</p>

	            <p>After locating resource deposits, the lease holder must obtain licenses and permits from federal, state, and local, and potentially tribal agencies to develop and extract natural resources. The federal government issues grants during the extraction process, including rights of way and rights of easement. These grants allow companies to build support structures for extraction operations on federal lands.</p>

				<p>For oil, gas, and coal, once a company wins a lease and starts developing and extracting, ONRR collects revenue from the extraction process in royalties. To facilitate accurate royalty collections, companies are required to file <a href="http://onrr.gov/ReportPay/default.htm">production and royalty reports</a> with ONRR. In addition, BSEE requires oil and gas companies to use <a href="http://www.bsee.gov/uploadedFiles/BSEE/Regulations_and_Guidance/Notices_to_Lessees/2012/NTL2012-N03.pdf">specific metering technology</a> to accurately measure production. BLM recently <a href="http://www.gao.gov/highrisk/management_federal_oil_gas/why_did_study#t=1">committed to updating its oil and gas regulations</a> to increase the accuracy of measuring and reporting production quantities. During this phase, BLM and BSEE also conduct announced and unannounced in-person inspections of production operations to enforce lease terms.</p>

	            <p>The lease holder must remove all facilities and structures following the terms of the lease, and take steps to return federal lands to an environmentally and economically sound state. The government often holds a bond, paid upfront by the company, as insurance that the lease holder will comply with all regulations and appropriately decommission the project and reclaim the site.</p>

				<p>For coal, OSMRE oversees state programs to enforce restoring mine lands following the end of a mining operation. BLM also oversees shut-in and abandoned oil and gas production sites so that they are reclaimed properly.</p>

	            <p>While most natural resources on federal lands where extraction generates revenue travel through these five phases, the details of the process differ by resource, and whether extraction happens onshore or offshore.</p>
