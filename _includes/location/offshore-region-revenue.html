  <h2>Federal revenue</h2>

  <p>Natural resource extraction can lead to federal revenue in two ways: non-tax revenue and tax revenue.</p>

  <p>When companies extract natural resources on federal lands and waters, they pay royalties, rents, bonuses, and other fees, much like they would to any landowner. This non-tax revenue is collected and reported by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR).</p>

  <section id="revenue-by-resource">

    <h4>Federal revenue by resource</h4>

    <p>Laws and policies govern how rights are awarded to companies and what they pay to extract natural resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. For details, read more about the processes for <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/offshore-oil-gas/">offshore oil and gas</a> or <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/offshore-renewables/">offshore renewable energy</a>.</p>

    <p>The federal government collects different kinds of fees at each phase of resource extraction. This chart shows how much federal revenue was collected in {{ year}} for production or potential production of natural resources on federal waters, broken down by phase of production.</p>
