    <!-- Sets up the federal-land focus of USEITI data, specifies what percentage of land is federally owned, and outputs the total revenue from federal land. -->
    <p>
      Natural resource ownership in the U.S. is closely tied to land ownership. Land can be owned by citizens, corporations, Indian tribes or individuals, or governments (for instance, federal, state, or local governments). Many USEITI datasets only cover natural resource extraction on federal land, which represents
      {{ site.data.land_stats[state_id].federal_percent | percent }}%
      of all land in {{ state_name }}.
