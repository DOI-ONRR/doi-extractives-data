  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>When companies extract natural resources on federal land, they follow laws or policies that govern how rights are awarded and what fees they pay to the government. The specifics of the process depend on the kind of resource, and often affect how much revenue the federal government ultimately collects.</p>

  <p>For details, read more about the different processes for awarding rights and extracting resources: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/coal/">coal</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/onshore-oil-gas/">oil and gas</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/onshore-renewables/">renewable resources</a>, and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/minerals/">hardrock minerals</a>.</p>

  <p>At each phase of natural resource extraction, the federal government collects different fees. This chart shows how much federal revenue was collected for each kind of resource during each phase of production.</p>

  <p>PUT THIS IN THE CHART: Companies may not know whether they’ll produce oil or gas until they explore the land, so fees are not differentiated by product until production begins.</p>
