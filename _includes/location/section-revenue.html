  <h2>Revenue</h2>

  <p>Companies pay a wide range of fees, rates, and taxes to extract natural resources in the U.S. The types and amounts of payments differ, depending on who owns the natural resources. Payments are often called ‘revenue’ because they represent revenue to the American public.</p>

  <h3 id="federal-revenue">Revenue from federal land</h3>

  <section class="container-half">

    <p>When companies want to extract natural resources on federal land, they pay fees depending on where they are in the process of using the land.</p>

    <p>Laws and policies govern how rights are awarded to companies and what fees they pay to the government in order to extract natural resources on federal land. The specifics of the process depend on the kind of resource, and often affect how much revenue the federal government ultimately collects.</p>
