  <h2>Revenue</h2>

  <p>Companies pay a wide range of fees, rates, and taxes to extract natural resources in the U.S. The types and amounts of payments differ, depending on who owns the natural resources. Payments are often called &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; because they represent revenue to the American public.</p>

  <p>Laws and policies govern how rights are awarded to companies and what they pay to extract natural resources on federal land.
