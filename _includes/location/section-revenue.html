  <h2>Revenue</h2>

  <p>Companies pay a wide range of fees, rates, and taxes to extract natural resources in the United States. What companies pay to federal, state, and local governments often depends on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/ownership/">who owns the natural resources</a>.</p>

    <p>
      Natural resource extraction can lead to federal revenue in two ways: non-tax revenue and tax revenue. Most USEITI data is about non-tax revenue from extractive industry activities on federal land.

    <h4>Revenue from production on federal land by resource</h4>

{% if revenue_commodities %}

    <p>When companies extract natural resources on federal lands and waters, they pay royalties, rents, bonuses, and other fees, much like they would to any landowner. This non-tax revenue is collected and reported by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR).</p>

    <p>For details about the laws and policies that govern how rights are awarded to companies and what they pay to extract natural resources on federal land: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/coal/">coal</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/onshore-oil-gas/">oil and gas</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/onshore-renewables/">renewable resources</a>, and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/minerals/">hardrock minerals</a>.</p>

    <p>The federal government collects different kinds of fees at each phase of natural resource extraction. This chart shows how much federal revenue was collected in {{ year}} for production or potential production of natural resources on federal land in {{ state_name }}, broken down by phase of production.</p>

    <h4>Federal tax revenue</h4>

    <div>
      <p>Individuals and corporations (specifically C-corporations) pay income taxes to the IRS. Depending on company income, federal corporate income tax rates can range from 15–35%. Public policy provisions, such as tax expenditures, can decrease corporate income tax and other revenue payments in order to romote other policy goals.</p>
