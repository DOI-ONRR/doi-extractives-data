  <h2>Revenue</h2>

  <p>When companies want to extract natural resources on federal land, they pay fees depending on where they are in the process of using the land. For instance, a company might pay for the right to explore for resources, pay rent while exploring the land, and then pay a percentage of production value once they start producing resources on the land.</p>

  <h3>Revenue from federal land</h3>

  <p>{{ site.data.land_stats[state_id].federal_percent | percent }} percent of land in {{ state_name }} is owned by the federal government.</p>
  <p>In {{ year }}, companies paid the federal government a total of ${{ revenue_total | intcomma }} to extract natural resources on federal land (or lease federal land for that purpose).</p>

    <p>At each phase of natural resource extraction, the federal government collects different fees. This chart shows how much federal revenue was collected for each kind of resource during each phase of production.</p>

    <p>Companies may not know whether theyâ€™ll produce oil or gas until they explore the land, so fees are not differentiated by product until production begins.</p>
