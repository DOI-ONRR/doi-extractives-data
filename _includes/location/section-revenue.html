  <h2 class="sticky">Revenue</h2>

  <p>Companies pay a wide range of fees, rates, and taxes to extract natural resources in the U.S. What companies pay to federal, state, and local governments often depends on who owns the natural resources.</p>

    <h3>Federal revenue</h3>

    <p>
      Natural resource extraction can lead to federal revenue in two ways: non-tax revenue and tax revenue. Most USEITI data is about non-tax revenue from extractive industry activities on federal land.

    <h4>Revenue from production on federal land by resource</h4>

    {% if revenue_commodities %}

    <p>When companies extract natural resources on federal lands and waters, they pay royalties, rents, bonuses, and other fees, much like they would to any landowner. This non-tax revenue is collected and reported by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR).</p>

    <p>The federal government collects different kinds of fees at each phase of natural resource extraction. This chart shows how much federal revenue was collected in {{ year}} for production or potential production of natural resources on federal land in {{ state_name }}, broken down by phase of production.</p>

    <h4>Federal tax revenue</h4>

    <div>
      <p>Individuals and corporations (specifically C-corporations) pay income taxes to the IRS. Depending on company income, federal corporate income tax rates can range from 15â€“35%. Public policy provisions, such as tax expenditures, can decrease corporate income tax and other revenue payments in order to romote other policy goals.</p>
