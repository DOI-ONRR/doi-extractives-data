# Data inputs
Most of the files in this directory are as close to "original" sources as we're
going to get. The directories are:

* `bea`: GDP contribution figures from BEA, the [Bureau of Economic Analysis](http://www.bea.gov/)
* `geo`: geographic boundaries of US political areas (states, counties) and
  offshore planning areas from BOEM, the [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management](http://www.boem.gov/)
* `onrr`: data from ONRR, the [Office of Natural Resource Revenue](http://onrr.gov/)
* `site`: a snapshot of data from the [v1 USEITI site](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/tree/e510dd45aaf95d3b4f63ea435d638beac55a6cf4/static/data)

See the README in each directory for more info.
