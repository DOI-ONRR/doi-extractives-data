The Fund is based on a simple concept: take revenues from the depletion of resources, offshore oil and gas, and use them to conserve parks, wildlife refuges, forests, open spaces, trails and wildlife habitat. It has supported projects in all 50 states and U.S. territories, creating community parks and trails and protecting clean water sources. The LWCF Act authorizes the Land & Water Conservation Fund at an annual level of $900 million, but Congress usually appropriates only a portion of this amount. While $900 million in revenue is deposited into a designated account in the Treasury each year, Congress has appropriated full funding to support conservation and recreation projects only once in the Fund’s 50 year history. A few places that were funded by the LWCF include <a href=\"http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/SPD/eaglenestlakestatepark.html\">Eagle Nest Lake State Park, New Mexico</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mitchellparkdc.org/history.html\">Mitchell Park, District of Columbia</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ofallon.org/parks/pages/family-sports-park\">Family Sports Park, Illinois</a>.",
