  <h1>Total revenues by company</h1>

  <h2>General concept and purpose</h2>

  <p>The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/">"total revenues by company"</a> dataset on this site provides calendar year 2013 natural resource revenues data by company. This is a new dataset that is a product of the <a href="http://www.doi.gov//eiti/index.cfm">U.S. Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative</a>. It represents cooperation between government, industry and civil society to create and confirm this information, and provide it in a way that adds to the national dialogue on natural resource extraction.</p>

  <h3>Scope</h3>

  <p>These datasets include revenues for U.S. Federal lands and offshore areas. It does not include Indian lands, privately-owned lands or U.S. state lands. The datasets currently include data tracked and managed by the Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resource Revenues.</p>

  <p><span>Companies below threshold. </span>
    {% for term in site.data.terms %} {% if term.term == "below threshold" %}
      {{ term.definition }}
    {% endif %} {% endfor %}</p>

  <p><span>One mine one product. </span>
    {% for term in site.data.terms %} {% if term.term == "one mine one product" %}
      {{ term.definition }}
    {% endif %} {% endfor %}</p>

  <h3>Why are some values negative?</h3>

  <p>This data is summarized based on accounting date (which is the date the revenue was reported to and accepted into ONRR’s financial system). Since companies can adjust and correct data up to seven years after a transaction takes place, this accounting year data includes corrections for sales that took place in previous years. This type of data is therefore most useful when analyzing dollars ONRR collected and disbursed in a given year. It also includes any values that are negative in 2013 because of corrections to previous information.</p>

  <h3>Why is there a Gas value, an Oil value and an Oil & Gas value?</h3>

  <p>“Oil & Gas” is the commodity category used for offshore oil and gas 
    {% for term in site.data.terms %} {% if term.term == "rent" %}
    <span class="term-tooltip" title="{{ term.definition }}" tabindex="0" role="tooltip">rents<i class="fa fa-question"></i></span> 
    {% endif %} {% endfor %} 
  and 
    {% for term in site.data.terms %} {% if term.term == "bonus" %}
    <span class="term-tooltip" title="{{ term.definition }}" tabindex="0" role="tooltip">bonuses<i class="fa fa-question"></i></span> 
    {% endif %} {% endfor %}. 
  At the time of lease sale, it isn’t known whether a lease will produce oil, gas or both oil and gas. After a lease starts producing a commodity (or commodities), the lease owner starts paying 
  {% for term in site.data.terms %} {% if term.term == "royalty" %}
    <span class="term-tooltip" title="{{ term.definition }}" tabindex="0" role="tooltip">royalties<i class="fa fa-question"></i></span> 
    {% endif %} {% endfor %} 
  . These can then be associated with either oil or gas. Hence, rent and bonus lines of data will be associated with an “Oil & Gas” commodity type, while royalty lines of data will be associated with either “Oil” or “Gas” commodity types.</p>

  <h2>Offshore data dictionary</h2>

  <p>The offshore dataset is organized by offshore planning areas. There are more offshore planning areas than are represented in our data. Those not represented had no revenues for calendar year 2013.
