 <p>I'm expanded!</p>
</Accordion>
```

Accordions are collapsible panels that provide users with the ability to expand
and collapse content as needed. They can simplify the interface by hiding
content until it is needed.

With so much data, hiding some is essential. This is especially true for mobile
where some content shown by default in the desktop view becomes hidden.


## How to use

The toggle behavior is triggered by the `aria-` attributes. `aria-controls` on the toggle should be set to the
`id` of the expandable content container.


## Responsive behavior

See individual variants for responsive behavior.
