state_production: |
    Much of Montana's crude oil and natural gas production is in northeastern Montana, in the Williston Basin, which includes the [Bakken formation](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications/special-studies/bakken/oil-production) as well as the Baker/Cedar Creek field, which contains the nation’s largest single underground natural gas storage facility. (There are also natural gas wells in south central Montana.)

    Montana's coal reserves, which are the largest estimated recoverable coal reserves in the U.S., are mostly located in the Powder River Basin in southeastern Montana. Five large surface mines provide the bulk of Montana’s coal production, though it also has one sizable underground mine.

    Montana has 25 hydroelectric dams and several utility-scale wind farms. The Montana Department of Environmental Quality maintains information about [wind power in Montana](http://deq.mt.gov/Energy/EnergizeMT/Renewable/windweb).

    **Nonenergy minerals:** In 2013, Montana's nonenergy mineral production was valued at over $1.3 billion. For details about what minerals are extracted, see the [USGS Minerals Yearbook for Montana](https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/state/mt.html).
state_land: |
    The state government of Montana administers 5.2 million surface acres of land (about 5.6% of the state) and 6.2 million mineral acres. For detailed information about land ownership in each county, the Montana State Library maintains [public and private land ownership maps](https://mslservices.mt.gov/Geographic_Information/Maps/Land_Ownership/Default).
state_land_production: |
    In fiscal year 2016, resources extracted on state land in Montana included:

    * 1,349,558 barrels of crude oil
    * 2,859,424 thousand cubic feet of natural gas
    * 4,748,656 short tons of coal

    For details about natural resource extraction on state-owned land, see annual reports produced by the [Minerals Management Bureau](http://dnrc.mt.gov/index/divisions/trust/minerals-management).
state_revenue: |
    Revenue from natural resource extraction on federal, state, and private land is a significant source of revenue for state and local governments in Montana.
state_revenue_sustainability: |
    ![Bar graph comparing Montana natural resources revenues to total general fund revenue from 2011-2014. Over that period, total general fund revenue rose from just above $2 billion in 2011 to over $2.5 billion in 2014. Revenue from natural resources stayed relatively flat at a little more than $0.25 billion each year.](/public/img/MT_revenue_sustainability.svg)

    In 2016, natural resource revenue streams accounted for 9.7% of revenue collected by the Montana Department of Revenue. Montana's revenue from natural resources has decreased by over 40% in the last three years, and the percentage of revenue from natural resources has decreased from 11.1% of total revenue that went to the state general fund in 2014 to 6.4% in 2016.
state_tax_expenditures: |
    In fiscal year 2016, Montana had four programs related to the extractive industries, which reduced state or local revenue by a total of $11.4 million. Of that total, a tax holiday on new oil production cost Montana $9.1 million in unrealized tax revenue and tax exemption on stripper well  production holiday cost the state $1.5 million. The Montana Department of Revenue outlines tax expenditures in its [biennial reports](https://revenue.mt.gov/home/publications/biennial_reports).
state_disbursements: |
    [State agencies](#state-agencies) distribute revenue according to the [Montana State Code](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca_toc/), which is defined by the legislature. In addition to receiving distributions from the state, counties also collect and distribute revenue from local taxes.
state_saving_spending: |
    In Montana, the coal trust fund is the primary way that revenue from extractive industries is saved for future use. The fund was established by the Montana State Constitution, which also requires that 50% of coal severance tax revenues go to the trust fund. The coal trust fund had an estimated balance of $988 million at the end of fiscal year 2016. Interest from the fund goes to economic development, water, and infrastructure projects. For more information, see the Montana Department of Revenue's [biennial reports](https://revenue.mt.gov/home/publications/biennial_reports).
state_impact: |
    The extractive industries play an important role in Montana’s economy — particularly in eastern Montana, where economic activity in the Bakken oil fields has a strong impact on local economies. To read more about the impact of extractive industries on Montana’s economy, see the [Labor Day Report (PDF)](http://lmi.mt.gov/Portals/135/Publications/LMI-Pubs/Labor%20Market%20Publications/LDR16.pdf) from the [Montana Department of Labor and Industry](http://dli.mt.gov/).

    Because of relatively high annual wages (compared to other industries), extractive industries contribute a greater percentage of personal income than jobs. In 2016, personal income from extractive industries made up about 4% (or $564 million) of all personal income in the state. The average annual wage for the extractive industries in Montana in 2016 was $88,220.

<!-- State governance -->

### State agencies

The state of Montana regulates extraction and interacts with extractive industry companies in Montana, particularly when they're operating on state or private land.

The [Montana Department of Revenue](https://revenue.mt.gov/) collects, manages, and distributes  revenue from companies engaged in extraction of oil, natural gas, coal, and nonenergy minerals in Montana. It publishes [biennial reports](https://revenue.mt.gov/home/publications/biennial_reports) and other [tax related reports](https://revenue.mt.gov/home/publications). County governments also collect many property taxes.

The [Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation](http://dnrc.mt.gov/) manages Montana's natural resources, including administering state trust lands and distributing revenue from state trust lands.

- The [Montana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation](http://bogc.dnrc.mt.gov/BoardSummaries.asp) is involved in all stages of oil and gas extraction. It permits all oil and gas wells, regulates the underground injecting program, and assists in remediation efforts. It also inspects all oil and gas wells and operations to ensure they comply with all state environmental laws. The board is governed by [rules and regulations](http://bogc.dnrc.mt.gov/rulesregs.asp), maintains a [data portal](http://bogc.dnrc.mt.gov/WebApps/DataMiner/), and publishes [annual reviews](http://bogc.dnrc.mt.gov/annualreviews.asp).
- The [Reclamation and Development Grant Program](http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/cardd/resource-development/reclamation-and-development-grants-program) funds some abandoned mine projects.
- The [Minerals Management Bureau](http://dnrc.mt.gov/index/divisions/trust/minerals-management) (within the [Trust Land Management Division](http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/trust)) permits, regulates, and collects revenue for extraction on state trust lands. Their work complements the work of the Board of Oil and Gas Conservation and Department of Environmental Quality, both of which retain regulatory authority over mines on state lands. State land leasing is governed by state [statutes and rules](http://www.mtrules.org/gateway/chapterhome.asp?chapter=36.25).

The [Montana Department of Environmental Quality](http://deq.mt.gov/) leads Montana's planning, permitting, compliance, enforcement, and remediation efforts for projects and incidents related to air, water, land, and energy.

- The [Air, Energy, and Mining Division](http://deq.mt.gov/DEQAdmin/AEM) is charged with protecting the quality of Montana's air, water, and land. Its responsibilities and roles include:
  - Issuing air quality permits for oil and gas wells
  - Issuing permits and monitoring compliance for projects relating to coal and hardrock mines
  - Determining correct control measures and establishing requirements to ensure compliance with laws and regulations
  - Providing technical assistance in bringing violations back into compliance
  - Preparing enforcement requests for the [Enforcement Division](http://deq.mt.gov/DEQAdmin/ENF)
  - Holding and reviewing reclamation bonds for [coal](http://deq.mt.gov/Land/CoalUranium) and [hardrock mining](http://deq.mt.gov/Land/hardrock)

- The [Waste Management and Remediation Division](http://deq.mt.gov/DEQAdmin/WMR) administers and oversees investigation and cleanup of extraction sites that need remediation, including state and federal superfund sites and Montana’s [abandoned mine land projects](http://deq.mt.gov/Land/AbandonedMines).

### State laws and regulations

The [Constitution of the State of Montana](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca_toc/Constitution.htm) includes environmental protections, including a right to a “clean and healthful environment,” and provisions for environmental protection, improvement, and reclamation.

The Montana Code Annotated (MCA) has several sections that govern natural resource extraction:

+ [Title 82: Minerals, Oil, and Gas](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca_toc/82.htm) includes statutes related to minerals, oil, and gas.
+ [Title 15: Taxation](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca_toc/15.htm) covers taxation. See chapters 35 (Coal Severance), 36 (Oil & Gas Production Tax), 37 (Mining License Taxes), and 38 (RIGWAT Tax).
+ [Title 77: State Lands](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca_toc/77.htm) covers state lands. See Chapter 3 (Rock, Mineral, Coal, Oil, and Gas Resources).
- The _Montana Environmental Policy Act (MCA §75-1-101, et seq.)_ aims to ensure environmental impacts are considered in state planning (including environmental impact statements).
- The _Clean Air Act of Montana (MCA § 75-2-101, et seq.)_ seeks to “achieve and maintain levels of air quality that will protect human health and safety and, to the greatest degree possible, prevent injury to plant and animal life.”
- The _Water Quality Act (MCA §75-5-101, et seq.)_ aims to "conserve water by protecting, maintaining, and improving the quality of water" throughout the state and to "provide a comprehensive program for the prevention, abatement, and control of water pollution."
- The _Montana Metal Mine Reclamation Act (MCA §82-4-301, et seq.)_ provides for reclamation of hard rock and metal mines.

The Administrative Rules of Montana also regulate natural resource extraction:

- [Title 36: Natural Resources and Conservation](http://www.mtrules.org/Gateway/Department.asp?DeptNo=36) covers the Department of Natural Resources & Conservation. See chapters 19 (Reclamation and Development Grants Program), 22 (Board of Oil & Gas Conservation), and 25 (State Land Leasing).
- [Title 17 Environmental Quality](http://www.mtrules.org/Gateway/Department.asp?DeptNo=17) covers the Department of Environmental Quality. See chapters 8 (Air Quality), 24 (Reclamation), and 30 (Water Quality).

### Fiscal costs of extractive activity

In addition to generating [revenue](#revenue) and [economic activity](#economic-impact), extractive industries can bring costs to state and local communities. In Montana, these costs are concentrated in eastern Montana because of extraction from the Bakken Formation in Montana and neighboring North Dakota. For more extractive industries' effect on this region, see the Eastern Montana Impact Coalition's [Regional Impact Analysis (PDF)](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/529fb9b4e4b0edf62d295374/t/55e9eb5be4b098674aefb5fe/1441393499939/Abbreviated+EMIC+Regional+Impact+Analysis+2015.pdf).

#### Transportation costs

The Montana Department of Transportation estimates an additional $52 million per year in increased pavement needs for highways in eastern Montana because of extractive industry activity. Local governments in eastern Montana also saw increases in budgets for streets and roads increase 44% to 345% from 2000 to 2013.

To read more, see the [Montana Department of Transportation report (PDF)](http://www.mdt.mt.gov/other/webdata/external/research/docs/research_proj/oil_boom/summary_mdt_efforts.pdf) on efforts to respond to impacts on the state highway system from oil exploration and production in eastern Montana.

#### Water costs

Surveyed communities in eastern Montana reported that water rates increased an average of 86.4% from 2011 to 2014 and sewage rates increased 302.9%. The Eastern Montana Impact Coalition also estimates that $33.8 million to $80.6 million will be needed for incremental improvements to support growing demand on water, sewage, and transportation systems. These figures don’t include large projects.

The Department of Environmental Quality plans, monitors, assesses, and enforces [water quality](http://deq.mt.gov/Water) in Montana. It performs targeted water quality monitoring related to oil and gas development in eastern Montana and coal mining near Lake Koocanusa, runs the [Montana Ground Water Pollution Control System](http://deq.mt.gov/Water/WQINFO/mgwpcs) and its permitting process, and produces [Clean Water Act Integrated Reports](http://deq.mt.gov/Water/WQPB/cwaic/reports).

#### Emergency services

Increased population near extraction can increase demands on emergency services. Law enforcement at multiple jurisdictional levels in eastern Montana have seen costs rise related to increases in oil and gas activity.

The State Highway Patrol added a new detachment in eastern Montana, county sheriffs' offices have seen costs rise $13.4 million, and surveyed police departments have seen an average budget increase of 128.9% between 2000 and 2013. Surveyed local governments also reported an average increase of 169.2% in emergency spending from 2000 to 2013.

#### Reclamation costs

Montana has been “certified” by the federal Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation program, meaning that it has reclaimed its identified high-priority abandoned coal mine areas. [Current projects](http://deq.mt.gov/Land/AbandonedMines/CurrentProjects) include addressing acid mine drainage in the Great Falls coal field, which is projected to cost $96 million, and managing subsidence events and potential subsidence in Red Lodge.

To learn more, find Annual Evaluation Reports for Montana in the [Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Oversight Document Database](http://odocs.osmre.gov/) or learn about the bonding of active mines in the [Coal Program Annual Report](http://deq.mt.gov/Land/CoalUranium/annualreports).

The Conservation and Resource Development Division of the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation runs the [Reclamation and Development Grants Program](http://dnrc.mt.gov/divisions/cardd/resource-development/reclamation-and-development-grants-program) to fund projects that “compensate Montana citizens for the effects of exploration and mining on Montana lands.”

The [Montana Department of Justice Natural Resources Damage Program](https://dojmt.gov/lands/) administers grants for the restoration of the Upper Clark Fork River Basin’s natural resources “due to mining and mineral processing operations.” Between 2000 and 2011, the governor approved 121 projects totaling $122.5 million.
