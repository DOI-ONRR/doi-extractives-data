state_production: |
    Most of Wyoming's natural resource extraction takes place on federal land, including a majority of coal production and two thirds of natural gas production. Much of this federal land is managed by the Bureau of Land Management.

    Northeastern Wyoming holds the Powder River Basin, which contains eight of the ten largest coal mines in the country. Wyoming's natural gas production is centered in the Green River Basin in southwestern Wyoming. Crude oil production takes place in the Niobrara Shale (in southeastern Wyoming), the Powder River Basin, and the Green River oil shale.

    Wyoming is one of the centers of uranium production in the U.S. To learn more about uranium mining nationwide, see the EIA’s [annual domestic uranium production report](http://www.eia.gov/uranium/production/annual/).

    In 2016, Wyoming produced 1.9% of U.S. wind energy. Particularly in the southeast part of the state, there's significant potential for increased wind energy production and several large-scale wind energy projects are in development.

    **Nonenergy minerals:** In 2013, Wyoming's nonenergy mineral production was valued at over $2.26 billion. Notably, Wyoming produces more trona (the chief source of [soda ash](http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/soda_ash/)) than any other state, and the largest deposit of trona in the world sits under Sweetwater County in Wyoming. For details about what other minerals are extracted, see the [USGS Minerals Yearbook for Wyoming](http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/state/wy.html).
state_land: |
    The state government of Wyoming administers 3.4 million surface acres of land (about 5.5% of the state) and 3.9 million {{ "mineral acres" | term_end }}. For detailed information about land ownership in each county, see the [Wyoming Statewide Parcel Viewer](http://gis.wyo.gov/parcels/).
state_land_production: |
    In FY 2014, 29.3 million short tons of surface-mined coal and 2.4 million short tons of underground-mined coal were extracted on state lands in Wyoming.

    For details about natural resource extraction on state-owned land, see annual reports produced by the [Office of State Lands and Investments](http://lands.wyo.gov/minerals).
state_revenue: |
    Revenue from natural resource extraction on federal, state, and private land is a primary source of income for the state of Wyoming.

    In production year 2016, all 23 of Wyoming’s counties had taxable mineral production, though over 70% percent of the taxable value of mineral production came from Campbell, Sublette, and Sweetwater counties. In general, the state of Wyoming collects revenue from extraction in the form of severance taxes and counties collect revenue from extraction through ad valorem taxes.
state_revenue_sustainability: |
    ![Bar graph comparing Wyoming natural resources revenue to total Wyoming General Fund revenue from 2004-2016. Total revenue rose from just under $800 million in 2005 to over $1.2 billion in 2008, then fell to about $1 billion in 2009 and 2010 before rising to over $1.4 billion by 2015. In 2016, total general fund revenue fell to just over $900 million. Natural resources revenues followed a similar pattern, and accounted for more than a third and less than half of general fund revenues each year.]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/img/WY_revenue_sustainability.svg)

    In 2016, natural resource revenue streams contributed 34% of the state’s total general fund revenues. Wyoming’s general fund revenues from extractive industries have fluctuated from $315 million in 2005 to $640 million in 2014 and back down to $337 million in 2016. The percentage of total general fund revenues from extraction has also fluctuated between a low of 33% (in 2009) and a high of 46% (in 2014). Severance tax revenues hold particular importance for Wyoming, and have accounted for between 13% and 20% of general fund revenues in the last decade.

    To read more about the impact of revenue from extractive industries on Wyoming’s general fund, including future projections, see reports produced by Wyoming's [Consensus Revenue Estimating Group](http://eadiv.state.wy.us/creg/creg.html).
state_tax_expenditures: |
    Wyoming does not report information on total tax expenditures, and does not have tax expenditures associated with oil and gas.
state_disbursements: |
    [State agencies](#state-agencies) distribute natural resource revenues according to the [Wyoming State Code](http://legisweb.state.wy.us/LSOWeb/wyStatutes.aspx), which is defined by the legislature.

    Prior to FY 2002, individual severance taxes had distinct distribution formulas. In the 2000 and 2001 legislative sessions, the Wyoming Legislature revised statutes — a process they called “de-earmarking” — to simplify the distribution process. The Department of Revenue now collects severance tax revenues, aggregates them, and distributes that total amount according to statute.

    At the local level, county tax collectors collect all property taxes on production and distribute them within their own jurisdictions.
state_saving_spending: |
    In 2016, the state of Wyoming saved about 52% of severance tax revenue and 27% of federal mineral royalty revenues. These two revenue streams are Wyoming's two largest sources of revenue from natural resource extraction. Wyoming saves revenue by contributing to the Budget Reserve Account and the Permanent Wyoming Mineral Trust Fund. Interest from the Permanent Wyoming Mineral Trust Fund goes to the General Fund.
state_impact: |
    The extractive industries play an important role in Wyoming’s economy — particularly in Campbell County's Powder River Basin and in Sublette County. For more information about employment in Wyoming, the [Department of Workforce Services](http://www.wyomingworkforce.org/) has published [long-term industry and occupational projections for 2014 to 2024](http://doe.state.wy.us/lmi/projections/2016/projections_2014-2024.htm).

    Because of relatively high annual wages (compared to other industries), extractive industries contribute a greater percentage of personal income than jobs. In 2016, annual wages from extractive industries made up about 18% (or $1.6 billion) of total annual wages in the state. The average annual wage for extractive-industry jobs in Wyoming in 2016 was $84,451, or almost twice the statewide average wage of $43,813.

<!-- State governance -->

### State agencies

The state of Wyoming regulates extraction and interacts with extractive industry companies in Montana, particularly when they're operating on state or private land.

The [Wyoming Department of Revenue](http://revenue.wyo.gov/) assesses, collects, manages, and distributes revenue from companies engaged in extraction of oil, natural gas, coal, and other natural resources in Wyoming. At the local level, county governments directly collect ad valorem taxes related to extraction. The Department of Revenue publishes:

* [Annual reports](http://revenue.wyo.gov/dor-annual-reports)
* [Rules and regulations](http://revenue.wyo.gov/home/rules-and-regulations-by-chapter)
* [Mineral tax distribution reports](http://revenue.wyo.gov/tax-distribution-reports/mineral-tax-distributions)

The [Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission](http://wogcc.state.wy.us/) ensures that oil and gas wells and operations comply with state environmental laws, as well as regulating mining activities on state land. It publishes [rules and regulations](http://wogcc.state.wy.us/wogcchelp/commission.html), and its activities include:

* Permitting all oil and gas wells
* Maintaining well records
* Performing field inspections
* Performing orphan well plugging
* Holding reclamation bonds on mine operations

The [Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments](http://lands.wyo.gov/home) leases, controls, and collects royalties from mineral extraction on state trust land.

The [Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality](http://deq.wyoming.gov/) (DEQ) leads activities to conserve the environment and support responsible stewardship of Wyoming’s resources. DEQ’s permitting process covers all activities associated with mining, from exploration to reclamation commitments.

* The [Air Quality Division](http://deq.wyoming.gov/aqd/) issues air quality permits, particularly in the Upper Green River Basin.
* The [Water Quality Division](http://deq.wyoming.gov/wqd/) works to ensure the proper disposal of wastewater, and monitors water quality. It also permits underground injections of wastewater, reclaims discharge impoundments related to coal bed methane production, and works with the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and Land Quality Division to regulate underground wastewater injection through the [Underground Injection Control Program](http://deq.wyoming.gov/wqd/underground-injection-control/). The Water Quality Division also maintains its own list of [rules and regulations](http://deq.wyoming.gov/wqd/resources/rules-regs/).
* The [Solid and Hazardous Waste Division](http://deq.wyoming.gov/shwd/) inspects hazardous waste storage and disposal.
* The [Land Quality Division](http://deq.wyoming.gov/lqd/) regulates surface mining operations and surface operations for underground mines, works to ensure reclamation following mining, establishes reclamation bond amounts, and holds reclamation bonds on mine operations. It publishes [annual reports](http://deq.wyoming.gov/admin/resources/annual-report-and-strategic-plan/) that include bond amounts.
* The [Abandoned Mine Land Division](http://deq.wyoming.gov/aml/) administers the federal AML program for coal and select hardrock reclamation projects.

The [Wyoming State Geological Survey](http://www.wsgs.wyo.gov/) also provides geological information about natural resources.

### State laws and regulations

Wyoming’s [constitution](http://legisweb.state.wy.us/statutes/compress/title97.docx) includes an [article governing mining](http://legisweb.state.wy.us/NXT/gateway.dll/2017%20Wyoming%20Statutes/2017%20Constitution/1/10?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=Publish:10.1048/Enu), Article 9, which created the Office of the Inspector of Mines and a school of mines, directs the legislature to provide for the development and operation of mines, and secures the right of action for injuries.

The [Wyoming Statutes Annotated](http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/wystatutes/) have several sections that govern natural resource extraction, including:

* Title 30: Mines and Minerals
* Title 39: Taxation (including ad valorem taxes and the Mine Product Tax)
* Title 36: State Lands (including mineral leasing)
* Title 35, Chapter 11 (from the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act): Air, water, and land quality, as well as abandoned mine land reclamation and orphan site remediation (see articles 2-4, 12, and 17)

Wyoming rules and regulations are maintained by the Office of the Secretary of State, which publishes a [rules search tool](http://soswy.state.wy.us/Rules/default.aspx) for finding rules by department or topic.

### Fiscal costs of extractive activity

In addition to generating [revenue](#revenue) and [economic activity](#economic-impact), extractive industries can bring costs to state and local communities.

<!-- Differences in revenue collection between states and counties can illuminate state distribution of those funds to counties to help them address those costs. -->

In Wyoming, analysis of those costs has centered on **Campbell County** (coal production) and **Sublette County** (oil & gas production):

* The [Campbell County case study]({{ site.baseurl }}/case-studies/campbell/) provides a holistic look at the impact of extractive industries in the northeastern part of the state.
* Most information about socioeconomic impacts in Sublette County and its municipalities comes from the [2009 Sublette County Socioeconomic Impact Study (PDF)](http://www.sublettewyo.com/DocumentCenter/Home/View/392). This report, which was commissioned by Sublette County Commissioners, focuses on whether revenues returned to and retained by Sublette County are sufficient, rather than whether enough state or local taxes are paid by the companies participating in extraction.

#### Transportation costs

In the [2010 Campbell County Coal Belt Transportation Study (PDF)](https://www.ccgov.net/DocumentCenter/Home/View/1910), Campbell County and the Wyoming Department of Transportation estimated that **county roads would require $43.9 million in investment** between 2010 and 2015 to support coal extraction.

Traffic increased 86% in Sublette County and its municipalities from 2000 to 2007, largely due to natural resource extraction. In 2009, they estimated that **projected road improvement projects would total $87.5 million** from 2009 to 2012 and beyond. The self-contained nature of large coal mining operations in Sublette County contributes to higher transportation costs compared to Campbell County.

#### Water costs

In Sublette County, natural resource extraction has led to population growth, which has increased demands on existing water systems. The town of Marbleton also drilled an additional water well to provide domestic and commercial water due to increased demand.

See [state agencies](#state-agencies) for information about statewide water management.

#### Emergency services

Population growth due to increased natural resource extraction can increase demands on the medical, fire, and police services of states, counties, and towns.

Prior to 2001, the Sublette County Rural Health Care District had two all-volunteer Emergency Medical Services (EMS) units. By 2006, the district had hired 25 full-time emergency medical technicians. From 2001 to 2007, EMS runs increased 116% for the Pinedale facility and 94.47% for the Marbleton-Big Piney facility. To serve the Jonah gas field and the South Anticline, the district built a new EMS facility in 2007 at Sand Draw. Local industry paid for $900,000 of the cost of the facility, with the county paying $500,000.

#### Reclamation costs

Wyoming has been “certified” by the federal Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation program, meaning it has reclaimed its identified high-priority abandoned coal mine areas. It also means AML funds, which are sourced from fees paid by coal mine operators, can be used for a wider range of purposes beyond reclamation, including abandoned hardrock mine sites. The program currently estimates that Wyoming has $77 million in unreclaimed coal AML sites and $18 million in unreclaimed non-coal AML sites (such as uranium mining sites). To learn more about recently completed projects and projects underway, search for Wyoming Annual Evaluation Reports in the [OSMRE Oversight Document Database](http://odocs.osmre.gov/).

See [state agencies](#state-agencies) for additional statewide reclamation activities.
