The subpage navigation is used to separate one main body of content into multiple subpages by year, or other category. Use when the navigation items create strong content groups worthy of separating identical information into multiple pages, but within one view.

Be cautious when combining this navigation element with filters, as it can be difficult to distinguish filter behavior from navigation behavior.
