  <h1>Total revenues by company</h1>

  <h2>General concept and purpose</h2>

  <p>The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data/">"total revenues by company"</a> dataset on this site provides calendar year 2013 natural resource revenues data by company. This is a new dataset that is a product of the <a href="http://www.doi.gov//eiti/index.cfm">U.S. Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative</a>. It represents cooperation between government, industry and civil society to create and confirm this information, and provide it in a way that adds to the national dialogue on natural resource extraction.</p>

  <h3>Scope</h3>

  <p>These datasets include revenues for U.S. Federal lands and offshore areas. It does not include Indian lands, privately-owned lands or U.S. state lands. The datasets currently include data tracked and managed by the Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resource Revenues.</p>

  <p>We are working on incorporating data tracked and managed by other parts of the Department. In the meantime, please see the following Excel files for <a href="{{site:baseurl}}/static/data/OSM_AML_Fees_and_Audits_and_Civil_Penalties_Final 3-25-15.xlsx">abandoned mine lands fees, audits and civil pentalties data</a> from the Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation, and Enforcement and <a href="{{site:baseurl}}/static/data/BLM_Permit_Fees_and_Bonus_and_1st_Yr_Rentals_Revised_6-22-15.xlsx">permit fees, bonuses and first year rentals</a> from the Bureau of Land Management.</p>

  <p><span>Companies below threshold. </span>
    {% for term in site.data.terms %} {% if term.term == "below threshold" %}
      {{ term.definition }}
    {% endif %} {% endfor %}</p>

  <p><span>One mine one product. </span>
    {% for term in site.data.terms %} {% if term.term == "one mine one product" %}
      {{ term.definition }}
    {% endif %} {% endfor %}</p>

  <h3>Why are some values negative?</h3>

  {% for term in site.data.terms %} {% if term.term == "negative values" %}
    <p>{{ term.definition }}</p>
  {% endif %} {% endfor %}

  <h3>Why is there a Gas value, an Oil value and an Oil & Gas value?</h3>

  <p>“Oil & Gas” is the commodity category used for offshore oil and gas
    {% for term in site.data.terms %} {% if term.term == "rent" %}
    <span class="term-tooltip" title="{{ term.definition }}" tabindex="0" role="tooltip">rents<i class="fa fa-question"></i></span>
    {% endif %} {% endfor %}
  and
    {% for term in site.data.terms %} {% if term.term == "bonus" %}
    <span class="term-tooltip" title="{{ term.definition }}" tabindex="0" role="tooltip">bonuses<i class="fa fa-question"></i></span>
    {% endif %} {% endfor %}.
  At the time of lease sale, it isn’t known whether a lease will produce oil, gas or both oil and gas. After a lease starts producing a commodity (or commodities), the lease owner starts paying
  {% for term in site.data.terms %} {% if term.term == "royalty" %}
    <span class="term-tooltip" title="{{ term.definition }}" tabindex="0" role="tooltip">royalties<i class="fa fa-question"></i></span>
    {% endif %} {% endfor %}
  . These can then be associated with either oil or gas. Hence, rent and bonus lines of data will be associated with an “Oil & Gas” commodity type, while royalty lines of data will be associated with either “Oil” or “Gas” commodity types.</p>
