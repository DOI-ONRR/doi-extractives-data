## 2017 Executive Summary

This report outlines progress made by the Department of the Interior and the Office of Natural Resource Revenue (ONRR) in 2017 on continuing to build upon the efforts of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).

This website (Natural Resources Revenue Data) will continue to provide data and information related to extractive industry production, revenue, and disbursements in the U.S.
