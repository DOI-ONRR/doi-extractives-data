      <h1>Hardrock Minerals</h1>

      <p>The General Mining Act of 1872, which regulates gold, silver, cinnabar, and copper in addition to “other valuable deposits,” was signed into law by Ulysses S. Grant. Despite some amendments, it is still the legislation governing extraction of minerals on federal lands except for coal, which is regulated separately. These minerals are collectively known as “hardrock minerals.”</p>

      <p>Later, the Minerals Leasing Act of 1920 limited the scope of the 1872 Act, providing different regulations for energy-producing minerals such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Today, non-energy mineral extraction on federal lands is regulated by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI).</p>

              <h3>Plan</h3>
              <p>Hardrock mining on federal public domain lands takes place in 19 states, primarily in the Western U.S.: Alaska, Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Within these states, certain federal lands, such as wildlife refuges, are not open for mining. While some hardrock mineral leasing occurs on federal acquired lands, the vast majority of hardrock mining on federal lands occurs on public domain lands through the claim staking process, originally outlined in the 1872 Act to encourage settlement in the Western U.S.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <div class="revenues-steps-number">2</div>
            <h3>Lease</h3>
            <p>If deposits are not known, interested parties can obtain prospecting permits on a first-come, first-served basis, which allows the permittee to explore for mineral deposits. Claiming federal lands for hardrock mining falls into two categories: deposits with well-defined boundaries are called “lode claims,” and all others are called “placer claims.” Each state has unique requirements for claim staking, the procedure of marking the boundaries of a mining area. Once a claim is staked, the prospector documents the claim by filing required forms at the state BLM office and with the county clerk of the county in which the claim is located.</p>

            <p>All mining claims are initially unpatented claims, which give the right only for those activities necessary for exploration and mining, and last only as long as the claim is worked every year. The original 1872 Act allowed miners to acquire patents to purchase federal land and put it to any legal use. Land could be purchased at the rate set in 1872: $5 per acre for lode claims and $2.50 an acre for placer claims. Congress prohibited this practice through moratorium in 1994; the moratorium has been renewed annually through the Interior Appropriations Acts.</p>

            <h3>Develop</h3>
            <p>BLM regulation requires miners to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the land. For activities which do not require the use of earthmoving equipment or explosives, the miner must submit a notice or plan of operations. These actions are processed at the local level because many states have their own laws and regulations regarding environmental factors such as air and water pollution, use of hazardous materials, or use of suction dredges.</p>

            <p>Additionally, construction activities require meeting the standards of a county code and state public health and safety standards. Miners cannot construct any permanent structures, mobile structures, or store equipment without the prior approval of an authorized federal official. The miner must pay an annual per site maintenance fee to BLM or — if a small scale operator — file for a waiver stating that $100 worth of improvement work has been completed annually.</p>

            <div class="revenues-steps-number">4</div>
            <h3>Decommission</h3>
            <p>In 1981, BLM issued regulations requiring miners to remove all facilities and return the land to a sound environmental state. In 2001, BLM expanded on these regulations requiring miners to provide bonds or other financial reassurances regarding reclaiming the land before beginning exploration or mining activities. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 created the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement within DOI to write regulations, fund state regulatory and reclamation efforts, and ensure consistency among state regulatory programs. The act also made states the managing agents of reclamation efforts. As such, states and tribes complete 90% of the abandoned mine lands abatement work.</p>

          <p>Fees are administrative costs paid by the claimant in the claim staking process. Since most hardrock mining occurs through the claim staking process, fees are the predominant revenues paid. For example, miners must pay annual per site maintenance fees to maintain the claim.</p>

            <h3>How to participate</h3>

            <p><strong>Contact a local BLM office.</strong> BLM has twelve field offices, mostly in the Western U.S. To learn more about land use policies for federal lands in your state, <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/directory.html">contact your state office</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Join a Resource Advisory Council.</strong> Resource Advisory Councils (RACs) in the Western U.S. give BLM advice on managing public lands and resources. Each RAC consists of 12 to 15 ranchers, tribe members, state and local government officials, academics, and other public land users. Learn about <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/resource_advisory.html">joining your local RAC here</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Volunteer.</strong> You can volunteer for BLM by searching for Bureau of Land Management opportunities <a href="http://volunteer.gov/index.cfm">here</a>. Or, find out how to create a BLM partnership <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/more/partnerships_home.html">here</a>.</p>
