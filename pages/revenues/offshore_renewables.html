      <h1>Renewables: Offshore</h1>

      <p>The process for developing renewable energy leases on federal land is different depending on whether you want to work offshore (which means, for federal land, <a href="http://www.boem.gov/Federal-Offshore-Lands/">more than three miles off the U.S. coast, but still on the continental shelf</a>) or onshore.</p>

      <p>The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created the <a href="http://www.boem.gov/Renewable-Energy/">Outer Continental Shelf Renewable Energy Program</a>, which covers offshore wind, ocean wave, and ocean current energy development.</p>

      <p>The majority of renewable energy development on the Outer Continental Shelf has focused on wind energy. For each state with the potential to harness wind energy, BOEM convenes a unique intergovernmental task force of federal agencies, state agencies, and tribes. This taskforce helps guide the project from land use planning through decommissioning. All taskforce meetings are open to the public.</p>

      <p>Offshore wind is a new type of energy development in the U.S. It is so new that many of its regulations are still being written, and none of the leases have started producing energy yet.</p>

          <div><p>There are 9 commercial wind energy leases on the Atlantic OCS. They are offshore of Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Virginia.</p></div>

                <div class="revenues-steps-number">1</div>
                <h3>Plan</h3>

                <p>BOEM identifies areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for wind leasing through a collaborative, consultative, and analytical process that engages stakeholders, beginning with a call for information and nominations. BOEM then reviews submissions, and identifies priority Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) offshore that appear most suitable for wind energy development.</p>

                <p>Alternatively, a citizen or American company can apply to lease lands on the Outer Continental Shelf that BOEM hasn’t identified, and BOEM will review the applications.</p>

            <li>
              <div class="revenues-steps-number">2</div>
              <h3>Lease</h3>

              <p>BOEM grants leases through either a competitive or noncompetitive process.</p>

              <p>In a competitive bid, more than one party is interested in acquiring the lease for a specific land area. BOEM will award the lease to the highest bidder who bids above a pre-set fair return value (a minimum bid to provide the public a fair price). In a non-competitive bid, a single party negotiates the lease amount with BOEM and is required to pay an acquisition fee.</p>

              <p>Once a bid is accepted and a lease has been awarded, the lease holder must pay the bid amount, called the bonus, to the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR).</p>

            </li>

            <li>
              <div class="revenues-steps-number">3</div>
              <h3>Develop</h3>

              <p>After gaining a lease, the lease holder will conduct site characterization studies (e.g., avian, marine mammal, archeological) and develop and submit a Site Assessment Plan (SAP) and a Construction and Operations Plan (COP) to BOEM.</p>

              <p>BOEM issues two types of grants during the development phase: Right of Way and Easement. Right of Way grants allow developers to build supporting structures, such as cables, for wind energy projects. Easements similarly allow developers to build structures on the Outer Continental Shelf to support wind energy projects.</p>

              <p>During this period, ONRR collects annual rental payments from the lease holder. Once the wind facility produces energy, the lease holder no longer pays rental payments. Instead, ONRR collects an operations fee, which is a percentage of the anticipated value of the energy created.</p>

              <p>As the wind energy projects progress, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) will conduct both scheduled and unscheduled inspections to enforce conditions of the lease.</p>

              <div class="revenues-steps-number">4</div>
              <h3>Decommission</h3>

              <p>Two years before the end of the lease, the developer must submit a plan to decommission and remove the facilities. BSEE will issue decommissioning permits and licenses. BOEM is currently developing the decommissioning process.</p>
