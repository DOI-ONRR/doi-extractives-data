      <h1>Renewables: Onshore</h1>

      <p>The process for developing renewable energy leases on federal land is different depending on whether you want to work offshore (which means, for federal land, <a href="http://www.boem.gov/Federal-Offshore-Lands/">more than three miles off the U.S. coast, but still on the continental shelf</a>) or onshore.</p>

      <p>Onshore renewable energy development on federal lands includes many types of energy, such as solar, wind, and geothermal. Large-scale renewable energy development is relatively new on federal land and many of the rules are still being written so you'll see some 'in progress' steps below, and ways to get involved in the rulemaking process.</p>

      <!-- <p>Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 provides the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) with the authority to issue rights-of-way for developing solar and wind energy projects on federal lands. Federal rules for renewable development are still being written.</p> -->

          <div><p>Since 2010, BLM has approved 25 utility-scale solar energy projects with a total capacity of over 8,000 megawatts. That's enough clean energy to power about 2.5 million homes.</p></div>

                <h3>Plan</h3>

                <p>Over last 10 years, the federal government updated regulations to clarify and encourage planning for renewable energy development on federal lands, in particular for wind and solar. In 2005, BLM published a programmatic Environmental Impact Statement to create a framework for developing wind energy on federal lands in the western U.S. BLM also amended 53 land use plans to allow for wind energy development. BLM field offices can amend additional land use plans any time to support wind energy development.</p>

                <p>In 2012, BLM released a Final Solar Environmental Impact Statement. This statement is another step towards creating a competitive leasing program on federal lands for commercial-scale solar development in 19 new <a href="http://solareis.anl.gov/documents/fpeis/maps/alternatives/Six_State_Alternatives_Final_Solar_PEIS.pdf">Solar Energy Zones</a>. BLM has also <a href="http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/wo/MINERALS__REALTY__AND_RESOURCE_PROTECTION_/energy/solar_and_wind.Par.4208.File.dat/Solar%20and%20Wind%20Competitive%20Leasing%20Proposed%20Rule.pdf">proposed a rule</a> that would promote the use of “designated leasing areas” for competitive leasing. These are preferred areas for solar and wind energy development because they have fewer environmental and cultural resource conflicts.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
              <div class="revenues-steps-number">2</div>
              <h3>Lease</h3>

              <p>BLM has suggested making two processes for awarding rights to develop wind and solar energy projects on federal lands, one for rights within designated leasing areas, and one for those outside of designated leasing areas.</p>

              <p>Within designated leasing areas, BLM plans to competitively offer leases for parcels of land for wind and solar energy development. People will be able to offer bids for the lease, and BLM will award the lease to the highest bidder, so long as the bid meets a minimum value (based on government administrative costs and the estimated value of the lease).</p>

              <p>Outside of designated leasing areas, BLM plans to offer right-of-way grants through a competitive process. The bidder who submits the highest total bid becomes the preferred applicant, which means that they are the only party that can apply for a right-of-way grant for a given parcel of land within that area.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
              <div class="revenues-steps-number">3</div>
              <h3>Develop</h3>

              <p>Under the proposed rule, once a developer gains a lease or right-of-way, they will have a set period of time to construct facilities and begin generating electricity from wind or solar energy. Within designated leasing areas, a developer has two years to submit a Plan of Development, and seven years to complete construction. Outside of designated leasing areas, a developer has two years to begin construction, and 24 months to complete construction. During this phase, a developer pays rent and megawatt capacity fees to BLM.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
              <div class="revenues-steps-number">4</div>
              <h3>Decommission</h3>

              <p>At the close of a solar or wind project, developers must remove all facilities and return the land to a sound environmental state. When an applicant wins a solar or wind energy lease or grant, they must provide BLM a bond. BLM holds the bond through the life of the project to ensure compliance with terms and conditions, including environmental restoration.</p>

              <p>Under the proposed rule, bonding requirements would differ based on whether the project is in a designed leasing area or not. Inside designated leasing areas, the standard bond amount for solar energy developments would be $10,000 per acre and $20,000 per turbine for wind energy projects. These same amounts would be the minimum requirements for bonds outside designated leasing areas, subject to adjustment by BLM.</p>

            <h3>How to participate</h3>

            <p><strong>Contact a local BLM office.</strong> BLM has twelve field offices, mostly in the Western U.S. To learn more about land use policies for federal lands in your state, <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/directory.html">contact your state office</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Join a Resource Advisory Council.</strong> Resource Advisory Councils (RACs) in the Western U.S. give BLM advice on managing public lands and resources. Each RAC consists of 12 to 15 ranchers, tribe members, state and local government officials, academics, and other public land users. Learn about <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/info/resource_advisory.html">joining your local RAC here</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Volunteer.</strong> You can volunteer for BLM by searching for Bureau of Land Management opportunities <a href="http://volunteer.gov/index.cfm">here</a>. Or, find out how to create a BLM partnership <a href="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/more/partnerships_home.html">here</a>.</p>
