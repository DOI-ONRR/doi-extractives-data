This site launched in December 2015 with the full data and contextual information of the 2015 USEITI Report. In response to user feedback in early 2015, we initiated a significant effort to make the site easier to understand.

This version of the site includes new content, new state-level datasets, and completely new ways of exploring all data.

## State and national profile pages

In our research, users looked for information about their state and expressed interest in seeing data about their area across multiple datasets. New regional profile pages provide a more complete picture of extractive industries at the national and subnational levels. To see how this works, explore:

* The [national profile page]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/)
* State profiles like [Texas]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/TX/), [Utah]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/UT/), or [California]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/CA/)
* Offshore areas, like the [Gulf of Mexico]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/offshore-gulf/) or [offshore Alaska areas]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/offshore-alaska/)

The profile pages also include more granular **disbursements data**, which shows how the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) distributes revenue from the extractive industries to [national funds and tribes]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/#federal-disbursements) and to state governments (for example, [Arizona]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/AZ/#disbursements) or [Louisiana]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/LA/#disbursements)).

USEITI also invited states to opt in to the reporting process, with the goal of making state-level data more navigable for the public. In 2016, three states worked with the {{ "Independent Administrator" | term: "Independent Administrator (IA)" }} to provide **additional state-level data** and contextual information to be integrated in their state profile pages: [Alaska]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/AK/), [Montana]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/MT/), and [Wyoming]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/WY/).

## Contextual information

The [How It Works]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/) section now has a question-and-answer format, along with several new elements:

* **Reconciliation data:** This data was previously available, but we've redesigned the presentation to make it easier to understand and view the full results of the [USEITI reconciliation process]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/reconciliation/).
* **New contextual information:** The {{ "Multi-Stakeholder Group" | term: "Multi-Stakeholder Group (MSG)" }} approved new content about [the Coal Excise Tax]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/coal-excise-tax/), [Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Program]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/aml-reclamation-program/), and [audits and assurances to ensure accurate revenue data]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/audits-and-assurances/).

## Other updates and design changes

We've also updated [county case studies]({{ site.baseurl }}/case-studies/) with more recent data, made content and design elements more consistent throughout the site, added terms to the {{ "glossary" | term:"" }}, added behind-the-scenes data tests, and made it easier to get to data-rich pages directly from the [homepage]({{ site.baseurl }}/).

## What's next?

The site is still in progress. Over the coming months, here's what we're looking forward to:

* A new [executive summary]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/report/) in late 2016
* Updated [reconciliation results]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/reconciliation/), with 2015 data
* More documentation about how the site is built and maintained

    ## Past versions

    > The initial USEITI beta site launched in early 2015, offering visualizations that showed how natural resources generate revenue across the country and where the money goes.
    >
    > This site, which launched in December 2015, makes the data easier to use, improves the site structure, and provides context about the government's role in extractive industries.
    >
    > We've also added new information and datasets to explore:

    * **Production data:** Sales volumes and revenue have long been used to estimate how much of each resource was produced. Here, for the first time, you can find more precise data on what resources were produced on federal lands. [Explore federal production data.]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/#federal-production)
    * **Federal revenue by company:** See what revenue the government received from production on federal lands, sorted by company. [Explore federal revenue by company.]({{ site.baseurl }}/explore/#revenue)
    * **Reconciliation data:** A number of companies were asked to submit data for reconciliation with Department of Interior revenue data. Of the 45 companies invited, 35 participated. [Download reconciliation data.]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/reconciliation/)
    * **How it works:** Beyond the numbers, we've included new narratives explaining how the whole system of leasing federal land and collecting royalties on extracted materials works in the U.S. [Learn how it works.]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-it-works/)
