# User Types
## Who we've interviewed
These are the types of users we've interviewed over the course of all studies since April 2018. 
![user types mapped on one triangle representing known questions, system understanding, and exploration and another triangle representing providing an answer, presenting data, and making a decision](https://github.com/ONRR/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/00_UserTypes/AllUsers.PNG)

## User Type 1: Question Answerer
Question Answerers generally come to the site with a known question and need to provide the answer to that question directly to the person who asked it. A large portion are internal ONRR analysts who field questions from external audiences and previously used the decommissioned internal site. Congressional staffers also often fall into this user type.

![Visual summary of question answerer participants, with the majority located close to known question for finding data on the site and close to provide an answer for usage of the data, defined as someone else is asking them for information or they have a specific question or number they need](https://github.com/ONRR/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/00_UserTypes/QuestionAnswerers.PNG)

### Goals 
* Answer a question that either someone else is asking or they know they have.
* Provide the answer to the question in whatever format makes sense, whether it’s providing a number over the phone or creating their own charts.
* Be a source of knowledge about natural resources revenue.
* Inform people about natural resource revenue data that they know is available.

### Pain Points
* Getting to a specific number
* Being able to easily share the found answer with the question asker
* Understanding terminology used on the site
* Understanding the context for a number (i.e. is it fiscal, calendar or sales year)

### Scenarios
* A **congressional staffer** needs specific, accurate data on oil royalties and disbursements because they need to provide support for a proposed bill. They’re able to quickly and easily find data about how much oil was produced on federal land in their state, how much royalty revenue was generated, and how much their state got.
* An **external liaison for ONRR** frequently fields questions from the public and congress for things that could be answered on the site, such as how much money the Gulf of Mexico generated from GOMESA. They look in databases for the answer to the question first, but use the site to verify the answer or for things they can point the question asker directly to on the site.
* A **BLM economist** uses our site to look up how much calendar year and monthly royalties and sales volume companies had to project future revenues and determine fair market values. 

## User Type 2: Agenda Supporter
Agenda Supporters are people who work for organizations, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or are political appointees or congressional staffers who are committed to a cause. They look for data to support their cause and may revise their agenda based on what they find from exploring the data. They generally want to take action based on their agenda.

### Goals 
* Find supporting data for his or her agenda.
* Work with the data and use it to inform people about how natural resource revenue data supports their agenda.
* Revise the agenda based on the data found.
* Take action based on the agenda.

### Pain Points
* Understanding both the detail and how it lives within the context of the bigger picture
* Knowing they can trust the validity of the site and that the information is unbiased
* Knowing where to go next to find information that’s not on the site to follow a thread to related data
* Having to pull separate numbers in a spreadsheet to understand the whole picture
* Determining what to do when there is a discrepancy between multiple sources of information

### Scenarios
* An analyst for an **NGO** is concerned about  how public energy resources are used. They want to determine how much federal gas is vented and flared and whether the government is collecting revenues for that production. The analyst can easily find data that they trust for gas production on federal lands and how the gas produced was used. They also want to be able to pinpoint specific companies that have high flaring and venting volumes, so they can be held accountable.

## User Type 3: Storyteller
Storytellers are often journalists and academics who want to understand what is happening and learn from the data whether there’s a story to tell. They also come to the site when they already have a story in mind and need a number or want to flesh it out with information from multiple sources. Their primary goal is to tell the story in a compelling and factual way.

![Visual summary of storyteller participants, with the majority of participants located close to exploration for finding data on the site and close to present data for usage of the data, defined as someone who is looking for the data to tell them a story that they can then share with others](https://github.com/ONRR/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/00_UserTypes/Storytellers.PNG)

### Goals 
* Understand what is happening with natural resources.
* Learn from the data whether there’s a story to tell and uncover any stories found.
* Flesh out the story with information from multiple sources.
* Tell the story to people in a compelling way.

### Pain Points
* Understanding both the detail and how it lives within the context of the bigger picture
* Knowing they can trust the validity of the site and that the information is unbiased
* Knowing where to go next to find information that’s not on the site to follow a thread to related data
* Understanding how the data ties to legislation
* Understanding how our data fits with other sources of data

### Scenarios
* A **student of public policy** at a major university is writing an academic paper focusing on how public land management balances recreation, energy production, and conservation priorities. They are able to locate federal production volumes and locations on the NRRD site and are able to use that data to inform their points in the article about federal government land-use policy.
* A **journalist** at a major regional news outlet is writing a story about policy claims about energy production on public land. They’re able to find data about production trends both at the national and state level and how those numbers tie to policy, which helps them back up their story with accurate numbers that haven’t been influenced by personal or political objectives.

## User Type 4: Domain Learner
Domain Learners are engaged at a higher level and want to understand the bigger picture. They are in charge of a domain, such as a federal government agency, state, county, or Native American tribe and want to know what is going on in that domain. They need to make decisions and answer questions based on what they see in the data.

![Visual summary of domain learner participants, with the majority of participants located between system understanding and known question, closer to system understanding, for finding data on the site and closest to make a decision, but also close to provide an answer and present data, for usage of the data, defined as someone who seeks to understand the whole picture for the domain they oversee](https://github.com/ONRR/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/00_UserTypes/DomainLearners.PNG)

### Goals 
* Keep tabs on how well the process is working for the domain or locality he/she is interested in.
* Make decisions based on what he/she sees in the data.
* Answer questions pertaining to his or her domain and the process.

### Pain Points
* Seeing the information for the domain or locality that they’re interested in all in one place
* Understanding both the detail and how it lives within the context of the bigger picture
* Being able to see trends in the data over time
* Seeing information on the website without having to download the data
* Understanding where the data comes from

### Scenarios
* A new **county commissioner** in a western state with significant oil and gas production on federal land ran for office largely on a platform of government transparency and accountability and wants to know how extractive revenues from federal land are disbursed at the state and county level. Using the site, they are able to find out how much was disbursed to their county and state each month, which allows them to hold the state accountable, advocate for their constituents, and inform public debate about extractive industry in their county.
* A **tribal leader** is concerned about the layers of bureaucracy involved in tribal land governance and is working with the federal government to simplify the process for land-use authorization. They are able to find information on the tribal leasing process to inform their efforts.
* An **intergovernmental affairs analyst** in the Office of the Secretary routinely pulls data to inform their interactions with Interior stakeholders. They have only one week to generate a GOMESA disbursements data trend analysis to present to Gulf state elected officials. They are able to find detailed, up-to-date GOMESA raw data to use as the basis of the analysis.
* A public affairs officer from an **oil company** uses our website to get numbers to use in press releases about their company’s extractive activities and to do comparisons against other companies.  They know the numbers are good to use because they come from a government site.
