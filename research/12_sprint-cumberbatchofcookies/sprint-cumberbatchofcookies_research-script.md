# Sprint-CumberbatchofCookies interview script

## Introductory comments

Brief introduction – share your name and a description of your general duties on the USEITI team.

Very brief discussion of the **purpose** of today's test:  "My goal today is to get feedback on a new page we're designing. I'm talking to people to get their sense of what this site is all about – what it does, whom it's targeting, where it's clear, where it's unclear, and so on. We won't use your name in our research notes, and the test should take about 15 minutes of your time."

"Please remember when I say 'test' I mean I'm testing our website and if it is clear or not. There are no wrong answers for you!"

## Main questions

_Show or send the participant the latest prototype state page for the state the user lives in. Either give them mouse control or confirm they've reached the page._

"I’ve got a sample page from our site here. This page isn't online yet, and is still in draft form."

"Imagine somebody sent you a link to this page and this is what popped up in front of you when you clicked on the link. I'd like to ask you some questions about what you see here and how you might navigate this page. If you could, please talk out loud as you explore and walk me through what you're thinking. This will help us understand how to improve things later."

1. Take a minute to get to know this page. (And remember to think out loud!)
2. What is this page about?
2. What questions does this page leave you with?
3. Did you learn anything that surprised you?
4. What stuck out to you? Or what did you think was interesting?

[SKIP FOR THE FIRST FEW INTERVIEWS] If there's time — or if conversation dies down — we may ask a few specific questions that should be answerable based on this page:

* Can you tell from this page what resources exist or are being extracted in [state]?
* Can you find out on this page how many jobs in [state] are in the extractive industries?
* Can you find out on this page how much money is going to the federal government?

## Wrap up

"Thank you for taking the time to chat with me today! If you have any follow-up questions, or if you want to be involved in future usability tests of our work, please feel free to email me [provide contact info]. **Last but not least, if you know of anyone else who might be interested in participating, please feel free to put them in touch with me – I'd love to talk to them!**"
