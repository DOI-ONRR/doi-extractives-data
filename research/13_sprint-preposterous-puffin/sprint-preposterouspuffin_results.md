# Research goal

The future of the United States’ participation in the EITI is currently in flux, so this research sprint was focused on hallway-testing a few versions of the homepage to help us choose a new name for the site that would help current and future users quickly orient to the site and understand what they could expect from it.

# Participants

We tested 3 different versions of the home screen with different combinations of words/phrases with ***[??? will update tomorrow morning when we get final numbers]*** participants over the course of one week.

# Findings

## Option A: "U.S. Resources Revenue"

Upon first glance, several participants thought “U.S. Resources Revenue” was the name of an agency. This helped the site feel official, but did not help them understand what they could expect from the site.

The word “resources” doesn’t mean enough on its own:

> “What does ‘resources’ mean? That could be anything.”


## Option B: "Energy and minerals data explorer"

Several participants were distracted by calling the site an “explorer.”

> "‘Explorer’ feels a little 90s to me.”

> "If you’re going for official, I wouldn’t use 'explorer.'"

However, many participants confirmed that “explore” works well as a call to action to begin exploring the data.

The phrase “energy & minerals” in the heading made it difficult for folks to conceptualize what the site was about.  

> “Hrm. I didn’t think about minerals. I wouldn’t think of oil, coal, and then... minerals? I am not as sure what this is about now.”

> “Is sunlight a type of energy we extract? Can I find out about solar here?”


“Federal land & waters” was hard for some folks to conceptualize, but helped others understand that the data covered offshore extraction as well.

## Option C: "Natural resources revenue data"

“Natural resources” helped people conceptualize what the site was about better than “resources” alone.

## Overall observations

The graphic we introduced on all three homepage options of the oil rig with a dollar sign beneath it was polarizing for some of the folks we spoke to, but definitely helped participants grasp what the site was about.

> "Oh, I see the picture with the drill in the ground with the money. This is about money still, yeah?"

> "Then I see the money sign underneath and I’m distracted by that - it feels opinionated in a way that I wouldn’t expect DOI to be opinionated. It feels like it has a connotation that we shouldn’t be doing that."

# Conclusions and next steps

Based on these findings, we’re making the following design decisions for the first iteration of the new homepage:

- **We will be going with “Natural Resources Revenue Data”** as the title/heading for our first iteration of the new language, given that most of our research participants found this heading clearest and most direct. We'll continue testing slight variations of this wording to further refine the language in future sprints.
- Despite causing some strong reactions, **we plan to keep the oil rig graphic** given its effectiveness in communicating what the site is about for most participants.
- **We plan to keep “lands and waters” somewhere in the subheadings or other explanatory text** to help users conceptualize that much fo the extraction is happening offshore. 
- **We also plan to incorporate the word “energy”** since this may improve the site’s Search Engine Optimization and findability, given that “energy” is a more common search term than “extractive.”
