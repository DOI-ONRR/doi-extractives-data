# Intro [~5 mins]

_Brief introduction – share your name and a description of your general duties on the team._

_Very brief discussion of the purpose of today's session:_ My goal today is to learn a bit about how you currently find and use information about energy & mineral extraction in your work, and get your feedback on a website we are working on to make this information easier to find. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk today – your feedback will help us make this site more accessible and easier to use.

_Interview details:_ During this interview, there are no right or wrong or desirable or undesirable answers - please feel free to tell us what you really think and how you really feel, since your honest perspective is what will help us improve the way the Department of the Interior shares information with the public. 

We expect the interview should take about 45 minutes. Does that still work for you? If you need a break or have questions at any point, please don’t hesitate to ask.

_Informed consent:_ With your permission, we’d like to take written notes today, but we will not include your name in our notes, or share the raw notes with anyone outside of our research team. Your participation in this interview is totally voluntary, and if at any time you want us to pause our note taking, or end the session early, please let us know. **Do we have your consent to take anonymous notes? _[wait for verbal consent]_**

Do you have any questions before we get started?

# General interview questions [~20 mins]

We found your contact information because we saw that you followed DOI’s USEITI Twitter account, so my first question is, what prompted you to follow USEITI on Twitter?

What interests you about energy & mineral extraction?
- _If their work comes up in this answer, but they haven’t told us exactly what they do:_ What exactly do you do for work?
- What do you love about your work? What motivates and energizes you? 
- What challenges do you face on a normal day? What about on a bad day?

Could you talk me through the last time you sought out information related to energy & mineral extraction? _[if you are on a video call and they mention any tasks that they did on the computer or websites they visited (especially useiti.doi.gov!), ask if they’d be willing to share their screen and walk you through the process]_
- What were you trying to accomplish? 
- What info did you need? _[probe around what formats they need]_
- Where did you go to find this info? 
- What did you do with this info once you found it?
- What was challenging about this experience?
- What would have made it easier for you?

_If the participant ends up screensharing and mentions they’ve visited useiti.doi.gov before, go to **[General usability test](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/14_sprint-inquisitive-impala/discussion_guide.md#general-usability-test)**_

_OR_

_If not, go to **[Wrap up](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/14_sprint-inquisitive-impala/discussion_guide.md#wrap-up).**_

# General usability test [~15 mins]

Before you stop screensharing, I’m curious if you’ve used useiti.doi.gov for anything other than what you walked me through before?
- _[if so]:_ could you walk me through that process?

_Potential probing questions:_
- What were you looking for?
- Did the site have the information you needed?
- Was anything confusing?
- Did the experience leave you with any lingering questions?

How did you first find the site? _[ask them to show you]_

Imagine a new team is taking over this website, and their manager is a good friend of yours.
- What one thing would you tell them to never change about the site?
- What would you tell them to change as quickly as possible?
- What’s the first new functionality or information you would ask them to add?

Do you have any other feedback about this site before you stop sharing your screen?


# Wrap up [~5 mins]
Great, thanks so much! I have a few final questions for you, and then we’re all done.

- Is there anything else you’d like to share with us?
- Do you have any advice for us?
- **Do you know anyone else whom you think we should talk to, or who you think would be interested in giving feedback?** _[if so, ask for their contact info or for an intro]_

That’s it! Thank you so much for taking the time to chat with me today! If you have any follow-up questions, or if you want to be involved in future interviews or feedback sessions, please feel free to email me _[provide contact info]_. Have a great day!
