# Research goal

Given that the purpose and content of the Natural Resources Revenue Data site is no longer going to be driven by the EITI, the ONRR team has an opportunity to revisit the purpose and goals of the site. Our goal for this research sprint was to conduct some exploratory research to learn more about the habits and needs of our target users related to natural resources revenue data in time for our product vision workshop in DC, to help inform our product vision & strategy moving forward.

# Methods and participants

For this quick round of research, we conducted remote, 45-minute one-on-one interviews with four participants, where participants talked us through how they currently access and use natural resource revenue information. In some cases, participants shared their screens with us to show us their workflow, and in these cases we also asked them to navigate through the latest version of useiti.doi.gov to share their impressions.

While not actual users of the site, these four participants all follow @useiti_doi on Twitter, and spanned several of our target user groups: one journalist, one academic, one academic/advocate, and one tribal government/industry representative. 

# Findings

## Users want to be sure they are using trustworthy data.
- One participant focuses on finding pre-vetted data, since “discrepancies within data from multiple sources can be quite large.”
- Another said, “I use EITI data simply because it’s been through a vetting process. Multiple countries and perspectives have looked at these numbers before they become public.”


## The scope of site is unclear to new visitors.
- Right off the bat, one participant asked, “is this for timber and mineral rights? What’s the revenue source?”
- Another participant was looking for information about coal production in New Mexico, and after scrolling up and down a lot on the New Mexico page, he said, “doesn’t have production data I guess.”


## Participants found the structure of some of the information to be cumbersome and unmanageable.
- “This takes a lot of scrolling...”
- In reference to the “How it works” page: “It’s a little long; there’s a lot of detail about government regulations. I’d have to be really interested to wade through all of that detail.”

## However, users need help navigating and interpreting the data, and the explanations definitely help. 

- In walking us through another site they use in their research, one participant said, “EPA’s site is much worse, you really have to know what you’re doing… Very little explanation for the categories where those numbers come from. Monthly frequency is adequate, [but] the overall schedule isn’t explained, though.”
- When a participant navigated to a state page on the NRRD site for the first time: “[this] seems like a very useful presentation of data on mining, production… useful summaries, guided tours of the data.”


## Ultimately, users need help orienting to how they can dive deeper into the data they care most about. 

- “the hardest thing to do is provide people with tools to help them dig a little deeper, answer the hard questions. I don’t immediately see how I might figure that out.”

**Visualizations are a good starting place.**

- One participant treated the initial visualizations they encountered as a “menu of options” of sorts, helping them orient to what data was available so they could identify what was relevant to them.
- Another participant described how they use another site: “EIA has some good visuals and also lets you pull down the raw data. [The visuals] give me a quick, easy, first look at the data.”

**It’s hard to find the raw data.**

- When asked what they thought the “Download” link on the site would do, one participant said, “I would say that’s a deficiency on the website. You have a lot of options, but it’s not clear how you would get the data.”

**Users need a clear next step when they can’t find what they need on the site.**
- The journalist we spoke with mentioned that when consulting data sources for their stories, they usually need to talk to a person at least once to ensure they are interpreting the data properly and understand the context around it. 
- For other participants, the data they were looking for was not provided on the site to the level of granularity they would have needed to be useful (for example, “it is difficult to segregate data for our tribal areas from the off-reservation data.”)


## Participants wanted to be able to compare the figures they were seeing with relatable anchor points so they could understand the numbers in context (eg, comparing local figures to a national average or to total national figures, etc.).
- When exploring “Revenue details by phase,” a participant mentioned, “ah, these bars are helpful, since I can compare visually… it helps me see our overall share of the energy production.”


# Open questions and next steps

Because this was a very open-ended round of research, and we were unable to recruit any frequent site users as participants on such short notice, this research sprint mostly uncovered areas we’d like to explore further in future sprints, rather than leading us to concrete conclusions at this stage. Some of the questions we’d like to explore further include:

- Who is actually using the site now? What are they using it for?
  - What can we learn about our current users’ behavior using site analytics? 
- What do internal DOI users need?
- What kind of information are people who make data requests directly to ONRR looking for? 
- Which user groups should we be targeting moving forward?
  - How do those user groups interact with natural resource revenue data currently? What are their goals and needs? How do they find the info they need currently? (We need to understand their current reality separate, before/instead of asking for their impressions of a site they don’t use)
  - Want to know more about folks who make data requests directly to ONRR
- How can we help people find and use the site?
- How can we better clarify the new scope of the site to help users orient to its contents better post-EITI?
- What kinds of labels and contextual descriptions do the best job of orienting users to the content they are looking for?
- How can we get people to what’s interesting to them, faster?
- How does the new site name and framing affect users’ understanding and navigation of the site?
