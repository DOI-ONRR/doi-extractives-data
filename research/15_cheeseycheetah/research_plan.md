Stakeholders: Judith Wilson, Greg Gould

### Background
Integrating the statistics.onrr.gov is a key goal of the revenuedata.doi.gov website. To ensure that the stats data integration is useful and useable, we want to know what is currently valuable.

### Goals
Understand what ONRR data is required for DOI employees to do their work and what their work entails. Also, what aspects of the statistics.onrr.gov site are valuable and where is there room for improvement 

### Questions
1. What do you do and what do you produce?
2. Do you use the statistics website (or other sites) in your work?
3. What aspects of the site work well, what do you struggle with?

### Methodology
A user interview will be held remotely with 5-10 participants. Each participant session will last no longer than 60 minutes and will include an interview and if possible a site tour of statistics.onrr.gov or other relevant sites. 

### Participants

## Discussion guide
### Intro [~5 mins]
Thanks for taking the time to speak with us today!

*Brief introduction – share your name and a description of your general duties on the team, and introduce any others who may be on the call with you.*

*Very brief discussion of the purpose of today's session:* My goal today is to learn a bit about the work you do in relation to ONRR revenue data, to help us identify opportunities to make this information easier to find and use.

*Interview details:* During this interview, we’ll ask you some basic questions about your work related to revenue data. There are no right or wrong or desirable or undesirable answers - please feel free to tell us what you really think and how you really feel, since your honest perspective is what will help us improve the way the Department of the Interior shares information internally and with the public.

We expect the interview should take about 45 minutes. Does that still work for you? If you need a break or have questions at any point, please don’t hesitate to ask.

*Informed consent:* With your permission, we’d like to take written notes today, but we will not include your name in our notes, or share the raw notes with anyone outside of our research team. Your participation in this interview is totally voluntary, and if at any time you want us to pause our note taking, or end the session early, please let us know. Do we have your consent to take anonymous notes? [wait for verbal consent]

Do you have any questions before we get started?
