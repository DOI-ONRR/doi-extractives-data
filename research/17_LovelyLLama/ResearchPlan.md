# Background/problem statement:
Disbursements data is either missing, incomplete or not presented in a manner that is effective in making the data easily understood which is causing confusion among users. By identifying and implementing a more effective way to present the disbursements data we can reduce the number of email requests for disbursements data. 
# Goals and questions

| Goals | Questions |
| :----- | :--------- |
| Learn what data is available to us. | What data is currently available to us? |
| | Could more data be made avaialable? |
| | What data do we want that we don't have?|
| Learn who controls the conditions for access to the disbursements data.| Who controls the disbursements data? |
| | How often does the data come? |
| | Is it possible to get the data on a more frequent or regular basis?|
| Gain an understanding of the format users prefer to see the disbursements data presented. | How would the user like the data presented? |
| | What does the user want to do with the data? |
| | What do they want to know about revenue once it has been disbursed? |
| | Which of these sites present their data in the most preferable manner? |






# Methods and desired participants:
Over the course of one week we’d like to speak with individuals from the following groups for 50-minute remote or in-person 1:1 interviews and 50- minute remote or in-person 1:1 interviews.
### Interviews: 
Senior Level Team Members that have access to the data. 
### Usability Testing and Interviews
#### (2-3) Journalists, researchers
We hypothesize that they want disbursements data that: 
* is verifiably accurate
* can be easily linked to
* is current
can be compared by location/ resource/ amount
#### (2-3) Advocates and NGOs
We hyothesize that they want disbursements data:
* that shows downstream disbursements to the local level
* by geographic area
#### (2-3) Policymakers (federal, state, local & tribal)
We hypothesize that they want disbursements data:  
* that shows downstream disbursements to the local level mapped by 
* by political district
* by state and tribal area
#### (2-3)Congressional Staffers
#### DOI employees (1 from each team {Budget, Secretary, Commuication, Data Retrieval, GoMESA)
We hypothesize that the DOI communications teams wants disbursements data:
* to satisfy journalists requests

# Recruitment strategy

In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups (both for this research sprint as well as to begin developing a recruitment pipeline for future research sprints), we’re currently planning to pursue the following avenues:
* Journalists & Researchers who cite ONRR content: 
* Search for instances where the NRRD website and data is cited in articles and papers.
* ONRR employees in charge of/ or knowledgeable of data sources
* NRRD team introductions to DOI folks who handle disbursements data
* Anyone who has knowledge of downstream data once it is disbursed
* States/Tribes/Counties (recipients of disbursements)
