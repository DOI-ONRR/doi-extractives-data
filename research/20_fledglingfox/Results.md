# What we tested
## Goals
* Determine the best approach for presenting key facts on the website.
  - Is the data presented useful?
  - Can they understand the information in the prototypes?
  - Which approach works best?
* Refine approach for disbursements.
  - Are there any usability issues with the design?
* Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall task flows.
  - Where does the site fit into the user’s flow of work?
* Determine the best approach for social media.
  - Do any of the options for social media work?
## Test Method
* 1 hour remote interviews
* Discussion of where the portal fits into their process
* Review of 6 key facts options (2 seen by 5, 2 seen by 4, 2 seen by 3)
* Task-based testing of disbursements prototypes 
* Review of 3 social media options
Prototype: https://vavl06.axshare.com/#g=1&p=start_1

# Who we interviewed
We interviewed 2 domain learners, 1 domain learner/storyteller, 1 question answerer/storyteller, and 1 agenda supporter.

# Findings summary
Determine the best approach for presenting **key facts** on the website.
* Users liked seeing trends over time and picked the options that showed trends.
* Users liked the sankey diagrams.
Refine approach for **disbursements**.
* The summary view works well.
* We should make the table header sticky.
* The glossary icons are problematic in the header row.
* We need to provide more clarity in how filtering and grouping works.
Determine the best approach for **social media**.
* Two of the 4 participants who saw the options preferred Option B.
* The other 2 thought it was misleading messaging.
Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall **task flows**.
* We learned a bit more about Domain Learners, but we had some participants who didn’t fit nicely into our user types.

# Key Facts
We showed 6 options to users.  


[Option A](https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/#g=1&p=option_a) Seen by 5 users

[Option B](https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/#g=1&p=option_b) Seen by 5 users

[Option C](https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/#g=1&p=option_c) Seen by 4 users

[Option D](https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/#g=1&p=option_d) Seen by 4 users

[Option E](https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/#g=1&p=option_e) Seen by 3 users

[Option F](https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/#g=1&p=option_f) Seen by 3 users

Because users picked the pieces that they liked from each, I ranked each piece of each design separately.

## Production
I took all of the reactions from participants and created a score for each design.

Favorite: +2, Positive: +1, Neutral: 0, Negative: -1

| Design | Rating | Comments |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |
| A | -1 | Participants weren’t sure who the audience would be and didn’t find the single monthly number useful. |
| B | 6 | Participants liked seeing the trend and comparison vs. the previous year. |
| C | -1 | This this was too text heavy. |
| D | -4 | Most participants didn’t notice this text and went straight to the sankey diagrams below. |
| E | 5 | Participants liked seeing the trend over time and the stacked breakout. |
| F | 1 | Thought it was easy to compare commodities, but want more than 2 years. |

## Revenue & Disbursements
I took all of the reactions from participants and created a score for each design.

Favorite: +2, Positive: +1, Neutral: 0, Negative: -1

| Design | Rating | Comments |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |
| A | 2 | Liked the comparison to the previous year’s numbers. |
| B | -2 | Participants didn’t understand the “2018 so far” concept and didn’t understand the different breakouts.|
| C | Revenue: -1 Disbursements: 1 | This revenue was too text heavy, but liked breakout of disbursements by fund. |
| D | 5 | 3 of the 4 participants we showed this too picked it as their favorite because they liked how it tied things together. | 
| E | 3 | Participants liked seeing trends over time and the breakouts. |
| F | 0 | A couple were initially intrigued by this, but then decided it wasn’t a close enough match to put them side by side. |
## Recommendations
* Use trend bar charts for production data - we have a monthly and an annual view that participants liked.
* Explore ways to make the sankey diagrams more readable.
* If we can’t settle on useful sankey diagrams, use stacked bar charts.
* Test the next round of designs with new users to make sure the key stats help them understand the process and don’t alienate them.


# Disbursements
## Summary View
[Federal](https://vavl06.axshare.com/explore_data.html)

[State](https://vavl06.axshare.com/explore_texas.html)

We tweaked the design after two participants had trouble knowing where to click to get to more data and the changes seemed to solve that problem.
* Recommendation: Watch for new issues in future testing.
## Table View
[Table](https://vavl06.axshare.com/federal_disbursements_data.html)

A couple participants make the table header sticky when you scroll.
* Recommendation: Make the table header sticky.
The glossary icons are problematic in the header row.  Users thought they would either be filters or didn’t know what they would do.
* Recommendation: Consider a different icon, like a question mark in a circle or put definitions somewhere other than the header (not sure where).
We need to provide more clarity in how filtering and grouping works.  Users thought the heading rows would expand the Sources and Commodities and some didn’t get how Group By worked.
* Recommendation: Consider a different label for Group By.  Changing the glossary icon may also help.


# Social Media
| Option | Participants who saw (across 2 studies) | Favorites | Comments |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- |
| [Option A](https://vavl06.axshare.com/social_a.html) | 6 | 1 | Hides the image, Doesn't hide the image as much as B or C, Propaganda, Not clear how the extraction ties to the park |
| [Option B](https://vavl06.axshare.com/social_b.html) | 5 | 2 | Hides the image less than the other options, Propaganda, Not clear how the extraction ties to the park |
| [Option C](https://vavl06.axshare.com/social_c.html) | 4 | 1 | Clearer message than the ones with the park, Propaganda |

# User Types
| Type | Findings |
| ---- | -------- |
|Question Answerer (half a participant) | One participant had question answering behaviors for finding data on the site, but had storytelling behaviors for using the data.  This is the second overall user we’ve interviewed who fits this behavior. |
| Agenda Supporter (1 participant) | One participant was an agenda supporter.  We expected him to be a domain learner with his state as his domain, but his behaviors were more like that of an agenda supporter with his state as his agenda. |
| Storyteller (2 half participants) | Two participants had storytelling behaviors when using data.  One has question answerer behaviors for finding the data and one had domain learner. |
| Domain Learner (2 whole participants, and one half) | Two participants were close to what we had identified as domain learners, but I think we may need to move where we place the domain learner on the triangles.  They do more question answering that we predicted. |

See [User Types Page](https://github.com/ONRR/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/00_UserTypes/00_UserTypes.md) for updated user types based on these findings.

# Summary of recommendations

* If we can’t settle on useful sankey diagrams, use stacked bar charts.
* Test the next round of designs with new users to make sure the key stats help them understand the process and don’t alienate them.
* Watch for new issues with the disbursements summary in future testing.
* Make the table header sticky.
* Consider a different icon for glossaries, like a question mark in a circle or put definitions somewhere other than the header (not sure where).
* Consider a different label for Group By.  Changing the glossary icon may also help.
* Refine the Domain Learner user type based on findings.
