# What We Tested
Prototype: https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/start_2.html

# Summary of Findings
## Home Page
* The home page doesn't do a good job of orienting new users to how the process works.
* The key facts make the map less prominent, causing some to choose the current home page as their favorite.
## Key Facts
* Participants liked having key stats on the home page.
* The bar charts worked well for users, with a few caveats.
* Sankey diagrams are polarizing.  They don't help new users understand the process, but those who know the process find them helpful to understand the scale of things.
## Explore Data
* The current Explore Data page is unwieldy.  
* Most participants didn't understand the difference between “federal” and “nationwide” production.
* The navigation seemed slightly more familiar to users on the left than the right, but not many commented on it.
## New Revenue Sections
* Participants had a difficult time understanding the revenue graphic, both for federal and Indian revenue.  
* Participants liked both versions of Revenue by Company summary and several suggested combining the two.
## Other Findings
* Participants wanted to be able to click on charts to drill into more details.
* Participants wanted the data more broken down than we have it.
* Participants wanted to get explanations for why numbers were off or changed.
* A few participants mentioned that it would make more sense to organize production by volume.

# Summary of Recommendations
* Explore home page designs with better how it works content at the top and that keep the map at the top.
* For Production, use the annual/monthly toggle and the numbers below the graph from Home 2 and drop the trend line.  
* Use the bar charts for Revenue & Disbursements on the home page.
* If we use sankey diagrams, put them lower in the funnel.
* Explore ways to make the home page graphics interactive.
* Explore options for clarifying the meaning of the top line on all vertical bar charts.
* Make sure the same color is being used for the same thing on charts that appear close to each other.  
* Consider using the blue colors more frequently because they are easier to differentiate.
* Use Explore B design, possibly with the short paragraphs in Explore D at the top to orient the user, and split up the sections into pages.
* Move the navigation menu to the left.  
* Use the table design for Indian revenue and consider also using the table or exploring other graphics for federal revenue.
* Combine the two Revenue by Company options.
* Move Nationwide to below Federal and Indian and test out different labels that also consider better calling out energy vs. mineral production.
* Consider adding lease level data.
* Consider allowing clicking to drill down for future chart designs.  
* Provide explanations when we can.
* Test different icons for the glossary.
* Organize the bar charts by volume.
