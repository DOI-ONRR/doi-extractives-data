# Background
We have revised the home page and Explore Data prototypes from the last round of user research.  We want to evaluate these designs with users.  A secondary goal is to flesh out our defined user types more by asking users about how they use the site.
# Goals
* Determine the best approach for presenting how it works content on the home page.
* Determine whether the map should come before or after key stats.
* Determine whether the design for interactivity in key stats works.
* Determine the whether we need the intro paragraphs on Explore Data.
* Determine how the users use the site as part of their overall task flows.
# Methods and desired participants
Over the course of a few weeks, we’d like to speak with 5-9 individuals from several of the following user groups for 1 hour remote 1:1 interviews.  We'll focus more on new users because of the goals of the study.
* Question Answerers: These are people like congressional aides and internal liaisons who use the site to answer specific questions.
* Agenda Supporters: These are people like those from NGOs or industry who use the site to see how the data supports an agenda they already have in mind.
* Storytellers: These are people like journalists and academics who want the data to tell them a story that they want to share with other people.
* Domain Learners: These are people like state and county government reps and tribal leaders who want to monitor what’s going on within their domain and understand the whole system.
# Recruitment strategy
In order to recruit research participants from our target user groups, we will contact people who have not used the site before.  We will be developing a strategy for recruiting participants via social media as part of the recruiting effort for this study.
# Test assets
We will be testing these 3 versions of the home page with users to understand which best helps new users understand the purpose of the site.

[Home B](https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/#g=1&p=home_b)
[Home C](https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/#g=1&p=home_c)

Interactive Key Facts (this will be incorporated into the Home page prototypes when finalized)
