# Who We Interviewed
7 general public participants, 1 question answerer

# What We Tested
Prototype: https://1rn7bf.axshare.com/start_1.html

# Summary of Findings
## Home Page
* Home C worked the best to convey the purpose of the site and provide access to learn more about each area.
* We need to make sure the tabs on Home C are visible.

## Data Highlights
* Some users were overwhelmed by seeing the data highlights high up on the home page.
* Users got how the interactivity for the Data Highlights works.

## Map
* Everybody liked the “friendly” map and many users said it should come before Data Highlights. 
* Participants noticed the offshore regions in the map much more than in other studies and didn’t get that it was showing ownership.

## Explore Data
* Users liked having context for the whole page at the top of the page.

## Productions
* Users had mixed responses to what the difference between "All lands and waters" and "Federal lands and waters", but better than in past studies.
* Participants kind of got the map descriptors for All vs. Federal, but most said it was gratuitous.
* Participants had mixes opinions about whether All should come first or last. 

## Links
* Users didn’t always know what to expect when clicking on links that take you lower in the funnel.

# Summary of Recommendations
* Implement the version of Home C with more visible tabs.
* Put Data Highlights section below the map, which is friendlier to new users and consider better framing the purpose of the Data Highlights section.
* Add interactivity to Data Highlights.
* Put the map before Data Highlights.
* Revisit the map design, since many users don't get that it's showing ownership and offshore may cause some confusion.
* Include the descriptions at the top of the Explore Data page and consider adding them to other pages, as well.
* Use the labeling we have in the production wireframe, but add a description to the top of the page.  The last participant saw this and it helped her understand.
* Don't use the map icons for production.
* Decide whether most of our users know what we manage to determine whether “All lands and waters” belongs at the top or bottom of production.  The descriptions at the top of the page will also help with this.
