# Sprint-SarcasticSeacow research results


## Hypotheses tested

For this round of research, we zoomed back out to a more general level of inquiry. We wanted insight into how people in our intended audiences feel about transparency and dialogue in the U.S. natural resource revenues system so that we can understand how USEITI might fit into their already-existing mental models. We did not test any specific hypotheses.


## Participants

- 7 people unfamiliar with USEITI who match our intended audiences (personas) and live in areas with extractive resources. We interviewed one person twice because during the course of the first interview, we realized that they also fit into another category, and we wanted more time to ask about use cases specific to the second persona.

- We talked to 4 people in Arizona, Wyoming and Alaska who work in journalism; 3 people in California, Arizona and Alaska who are expert data users; and 1 person who is a concerned citizen in a southern Illinois community that is impacted by mining. Since we only have talked to one person of our 'concerned citizen' persona type, we will save analysis of that until we talk to more people. These results only cover the journalists and advanced data users.


## Journalists

### How do journalists find stories?

None of the people was talked to knew about USEITI or our website, even though several, after looking at the site, said something to the effect of 'oh, this could have been useful for X story I did, if only I had known about it'. This means that our work is not being promoted in places that journalists usually find leads.

Where do journalists find information then?

- _I spend most of day hunting for news and subscribe to lots of listservs and watch Twitter and Facebook. I use Google Scholar to find new studies, and I’m plugged into Northern Arizona University and their public affairs and press, as well as several clearinghouse sites. I use a Eureka alert [a popular online media service] to gather press releases. Sometimes people call with tips, which makes my life way easier._

- _Northern Arizona University does media release emails. I also just have a contact with the person there who publishes it, and she told me that that report is coming out soon [which is how I knew about a story about uranium]. I sign up for Eureka alert, which has a good list of papers coming out, and that comes up daily. Then kinda environmental non-profits. They’re always sending out their news release blasts. ADEQ [Arizona Department of Environmental Quality] has stuff. EIA has emails, I’m on their list for wind and something else, I forget, I had to pare it down because I got too many emails from EIA._

**Design Mandate:** We should focus outreach to journalists in the places that they are used to finding information. We likely need to consistently maintain outreach campaigns if we hope to be effective.


### How do journalists decide if something is interesting and worth writing about?

Journalists are definitely looking for stories that have local impact, but often are also interested in connecting their local issues to our national story.

- _There are standards for that [what stories should be written] — news spots have to be timely and local (I'm a science reporter, so I can stretch a little...but it has to be at least interesting to local folks)._

- _Definitely we want to serve our local audience, but the reality is that there is a finite audience in Wyoming. We’ve got a half million people in the whole state. So one of the goals is do content that is appealing beyond the state. Something of interest to those not in Wyoming but have some sort of infatuation for something with the west._

- _One of the fun parts about working in Alaska is that data reporting is still kinda new. We’re just getting to the point where we can do this. The documentation doesn’t go that far back, so that in-depth analysis is still nascent. Alaska is the state that makes the US an arctic nation, but it gets cut off the map and dropped from stories all the time. I think there’s a ton of untapped potential._

**Design Mandate:** Our design should provide easy ways to zoom in and out of data. People need to be able to find their local interest, as well as understand its national context.


## Advanced data users

### More interested in the more obscure datasets

Across the board, people weren't terribly interested in our reconciliation dataset when we showed it to people in usability testing. However, one of our advanced data users was very excited about it, and I expect this reaction could be more common in that user type.

- _This is for reported revenue? For companies based on government? That’s interesting and useful! Usually this isn’t the kind of thing that’s easy to find. We’d usually have to dig for numbers and verify them. This is great that they’re being highlighted where they’re different._

- _I feel like Alaska is more aware of this sort of thing. People know companies, how they operate._

**Design Mandate:** Likely every dataset we release will be useful to someone. We need make data on our site easily findable and sortable so that people who are *not* interested in the more obscure stuff don't have to slog through it, and the people who *do* want it can get it.


## Both journalists and advanced data folks

### What data is needed?

Across the board, people want long-term data to spot trends. If there is no long-term data, then even more contextual information is needed to understand what a single data point means.

This also speaks to the previous question about deciding what's interesting. Even those journalists that said they were mostly interested in local news still searched for national data to put their local news stories in context.

- _I feel like the long-term data is more important. How the numbers change over time. Long-term comparisons. You can’t really notice stories without seeing how things change over time. It’s harder on the short term. [Pause] Let me rephrase. If you’re looking at one kind of data, like financial data, you need to look at it over time. If you’re looking at a short time frame, you need context so you can learn something._

- _I used the Energy Information Administration (EIA) website — looking for info about whether nuclear power plants were on the rise nationally and all over the world. That was tricky to find, and I wound up having to pull things into a spreadsheet and play with it. Turned out the trend WASN’T really true._

- _I’m usually trying to find numbers to put it in context. So how does this wind farm compare to generation state-wide? What is the status of the wind industry across the nation? I was looking at numbers and thinking about how can I put this local event or place or whatever into a broader picture._

**Design Mandate:** Data over time is ideal. If that can't be provided, more context is ideal. In both cases, ways to easily find and compare related information throughout the site is needed.


### How do people want to use our data? What were they trying to do, and what did they expect?

People generally wanted to easily search for the specific state or county that they were interested in. Interestingly, though, they didn't want to use our search feature. They tended to say that they would typically scan a website, find a block of information that might be relevant, and use control-F to try to find the term they're looking for. They tended to want data or information in big pieces because they felt that this would make things easier to deal with and search through.

- _I guess it’s always helpful to be able to see visuals to get a general sense, and then be able to see the data. I need to be able to download the data and control-F Coconino County because I’m trying to find local._

- _Honestly, because we’re always so pressed for time, reading through tons of text is bad. I want to be able to keyword search and skip to exactly what I need. I mean, I can skim, but that takes a while. Big PDFs that aren’t searchable, that’s terrible. Anything where I can’t trace back the data and do my own back-checking or manipulate it on my own is annoying._

- _It doesn’t really matter what file type is there, as long as I can download it and get to it._

-	_The ability to download everything [in one file] is more useful than having to download several files to make everything work._

**Design Mandate:** Our site meets some of this criteria already because we committed to providing open, machine-readable data early on (very few PDFs). However, right now, it is not easy to pull all information on a single state or county together into one, easily-searchable place. This should be a focus of future iterations.


### What data/information would be useful?

People generally felt that basic revenue information was already available elsewhere and not particularly interesting or value-add. They were excited about the possibility of connected contextual information; for example, clear explanations of relevant processes, and links to further information. In addition, people were interested in lease terms, disbursements, and who to contact (ie, a source in the journalist sense of 'someone I can talk to') for more information.

Note: these responses came up in general conversation about energy reporting and data in the US. To a large extent, the participants didn't know what was available on the site. These responses reflect what the participants need to do their work.

- _There’s huge concern about native rights, subsistence rights, access, scope, — what’s most important is often about the impact on the people, as much as about the ownership/money. Protected impacts, and scope; the stories tend to focus around that rather than revenue._

- _The one thing that is important, working as a journalist, is that other data beyond revenue/financial is really important to the stories — transparency around contracts, lease terms, terms/commitments for the company and government. It’s that other data beyond revenues, the obligations on the government and on the companies. A clear picture on what things are supposed to happen and when._

- _Disbursement data would be super interesting. And also useful. I know the details of federal laws, but I don’t necessarily remember it off the top of my head all the time. It would be nice to have someplace easy to go to to understand, like, how LWCF gets appropriated but not allocated every year._

- _One thing that’s really helpful to me on the front end is if a site leads me to a source, i.e. a list of mines in my area or plants in my area; this helps me find who to call and talk to for the story._

- _Right now people use FOIA, and try to track things down through BLM, Interior, BOEM, a wonderfully complex nest of international and national websites. It is not clear where things are._

- _I do need to find law/policy regularly as background info. Today I’m working on a spot that involves the 1971 Wild Horse and Burro Act. Usually easy to find the actual language of the legislation, but harder to find follow-up reports or data. It’s usually out there, but just a matter of whether the research has been done._

- _In general, I literally spent like 10 minute on this, I wanted to know where the revenue comes in Coconino County. I’d be sweet if -- maybe I didn’t click the right spot -- I’d like to know what industry that revenue is coming from in my county. And how Coconino County compares to other counties. It sounded like the site ranked states, but could counties be ranked, too? And is there a way to follow that money to county coffers? Or is there a way to compare costs to counties to the revenue? What sort of impacts these counties have? Revenues coming in versus how much the county estimated they would spend. Because that’s where the interesting things are, right? Is the county getting a benefit for the spend._


**Design Mandate:** We do have some of this already on the site, but the current structure doesn't clearly link related pieces of information together across sections. We need to spend time better curating the content that's already available on the site. We also need to get the disbursement data that we already have up on the site in a way that links through to the other datasets. It would be great to get more lease information as well. Either way, there is likely much to be gained from focusing more on site 'connecting tissue'.


### People prefer government sources of information

People prefer using government sources of information because they perceive them to be more trustworthy than any other source.

- _It was difficult to find specifics on the Arizona mines. I was trying to track down whether certain mines were open or closed, or temporarily closed. I never found that from an ‘outside, unbiased source.’ I had to rely on industry information._

- _I usually try to go to Arizona government sources because I can’t necessarily trust industry or nonprofit data. I usually use state or local sources. I only occasionally need national data._

- _Preferred sources are government sources, or something from a research institution. I’ll use company numbers if I can’t get it anywhere else._

_Did I miss a “who we are” on the website? That is an interesting story! How all these groups came together to create this. The site seems very neutral. [this was prompted after our talk about the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan -- it had a vision, but EITI somewhat intentionally doesn’t have an opinion]_

**Design Mandate:** We decided early on to use government datasets and to make sure our design and content emphasized the collaborative and neutral nature of USEITI. This data further supports that choice. We could consider telling the MSG story in a more engaging way to build the USEITI (hopefully trusted!) brand.


### Printing needs to happen

People need to be able to share our site in places without internet, or attach printouts to meeting minutes and emails.

- _Also, the site didn’t print well. Lots of white space, not as impactful. I went to print this so I could send it to our board in the way that we usually send emails (attachments with more information). I would have liked the list of state rankings and amount of revenue per state. And the case study. Since it didn’t work, we provided the link, but I’m not sure anyone clicked on it. Our board members aren’t going to go surfing the internet. Data people, sure._

**Design Mandate:** We should add a print stylesheet to the site so that our pages print better.


### What USEITI is doing is important!

People really appreciate what we're trying to do, and feel that it could have a positive impact on their work, and on the lives of people in their communities.

- _I don’t think there’s any such thing as too much information about these industries. Even if it's just a journalistic resource, with such a large amount of information that it needs journalistic interpretation, that would be very important._

- _We have two dedicated energy reporters on staff. We only have seven full-time reporters in the new room, so that’s big deal. Two of them focus on energy._

- _The more information [we have], the better we can wrap our heads around the changes [that will be coming because of moving away from fossil fuels]. Hopefully, get ahead of the changes instead of being so reactive. Oil is up! Get the party hats! Hopefully, information in the right hands would lead to more proactive approach. How do we adapt to it changing? These are critical questions to the livelihood of the state._

- _I spent like two hours this weekend downloading all the state spending data off the website, because they’re all in PDF, so I have a fun time ahead of me. What can I do to help? I want to help anyone who’s trying to make data more available._

- _Overall I think this is an interesting site and I would want to spend more time on it. It would at least be a starting point to get into the data or revenues without the need to FOIA._

- _Yes! [This is useful!] If you ask our folks here in Arizona, we’d say that we must be a top revenue-generator for the country [because of our copper mines]. But when you go on the site, we don’t even register because of the 1872 Mining Law, but I mean even rock salt is higher than us [at providing federal revenue]!_

- _The labor statistics are also interesting. I mean, I guess it was a coincidence, but the EITI stuff came out at the same time as Sierrita [Mine] announced that they’d have to lay off workers because of the downturn in the market. This could not have been on the site, since the county case study data is a few years old. This shows how hard it is to find this information in the counties, with each one on a different system, not to mention the states, too. It’s so hard to pull all this together!_



## What problems were most severe?

### Linking related information and data across the site

Several of these topics touch on being able to find national information and local information, and all its related contextual pieces. Our site currently has many pages that act more like individual articles without a story or framework to pull them together. We need to better link across all that info to make it useful.

Related, we also need a better way to pull all info on a state, and all info on a county, into one place.
