## Goals / Questions
Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Evaluate explore data landing page | Do people understand the full breadth of what's available, or do they only see what's on top?
Evaluate feedback process | Do people know that they can provide feedback, or contact USEITI?
 | Do people feel encouraged to provide feedback?
 | Do people know which feedback mechanism is the right one for their concern?
Evaluate links to DOI leasing process contacts | Are the contacts we're providing linking people to the right places for their concerns?
 | Is 'get involved' the next step people expect?
 Evaluate whether we're meeting EITI goals | Can people find out which states/communities are the most economically dependent on extractive industries? (EITI was originally designed to address the resource curse)
 | Can people find out which states/communities collect the most revenues from extractive industries? (This gets at local legal and fiscal policy, since revenue isn't just a function of resources produced, but also of the laws, regulations, and land types in place)
 | Do people understand which states/communities have the most employment from extractive industries compared to other industries? (This gets at relative resource dependence again given the diversity of some economies vs. others, but also the capital-intensive nature of some extractive industries)
 Terminology | In the by-company revenues data, there are two rolled up categories: 'below threshold' and 'one mine one product'. These are explained in the documentation, but there is no direct link to the explanation from the table line items. Is this confusing?
  | It is potentially confusing for people to see "revenue" throughout site because "federal revenue" = "company payment". It might be hard to tell which direction we're talking about throughout the site. In particular, some people might misinterpret "revenue" on the by-company-revenue page to mean it's the company's total revenue, rather than the government's total revenue FROM that company.
