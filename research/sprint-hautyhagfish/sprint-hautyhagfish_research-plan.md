# Sprint-HautyHagfish research plan


## Goals
For this round of research, we're zooming back out to a more general level of inquiry. We want insight into how people feel about transparency and dialogue in the U.S. natural resource revenues system so that we can understand how USEITI might fit into their already-existing mental models. We will be conducting interviews with participants in the states and counties that USEITI has identified as focus areas.


## Background

We moved from broad research to usability testing in the last quarter (in particular around global navigation and information architecture) so that we'd have a usable and useful version one site launch in December 2015. Now that we have a live site to test, we're going to zoom out again and do research on user needs and whether or not our site is addressing those needs. This will influence which features we choose to prioritize in the future.

With the first launch, we think we've met some of the outcomes we hoped to achieve. For more details, see our [January 2016 research summary](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/summary-jan2016.md) that discusses our March 2015 problem statement, its metrics, and where we stand in January 2016. We've updated our [problem statement](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/wiki/Problem-statement) to adjust those metrics and statements to help us focus on our remaining challenges.
