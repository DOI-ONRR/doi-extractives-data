# Sprint-PocketMouse research plan

## Goals / Questions
Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Evaluate global navigation | Do people understand the terms we've chosen for the global navigation?
 | What do people think they'll find if they click on those terms?
Evaluate glossary indicator | Do people understand what the glossary icon means?
Evaluate front page | Do people understand what the site is about?
Prioritize what to fix | What problems are most severe?


## Background

We are continuing to fine-tune the global navigation micro-copy on our site beased on the results from Sprint-MightyMoose research. Changes in this testing round include:

1. Changing 'local impact' to 'case studies' to more accurately reflect what's found under that link. Previously, people expected a much more robust set of content than we have for the December version of the site.

1. Pulling 'utility'-type links into a separate global navigation chunk. This includes 'downloads', 'glossary', and search.

1. Creating two options for the glossary icon to test. The icon itself is no longer in a tab on the upper right. It is instead used throughout the site to indicate when there is a word that is defined in the glossary, and when clicked will open the glossary drawer.

1. Adding a 'Learn more about USEITI' text link to the intro block.

More information on the proposed information architecture writ large is [here](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/issues/622).


### Metrics

* Whether participants understand what they'll find when they click on words in the global navigation
* Whether participants understand that click on an underlined word with a book icon means that we have a glossary of extraction terms that they can access.
* Whether participants understand what the USEITI is


## Methods
* 10 min interviews with people unfamiliar with USEITI
* Notes, no recording
* In-person and remote


## Script

Script available [here](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/sprint-pocketmouse/sprint-pocketmouse_interview-script.md).


## Test asset(s)

We have two versions of this test, one with a simpler glossary icon (open book) and one with a slightly more complex icon (open book with bookmark). We will start testing with the simpler icon, but if that is not clear, move to the more complex icon.

Liveshare coming soon.
