# Sprint-PocketMouse research results


## Hypotheses tested

- Do people understand the terms we've chosen for the global navigation? EVER-CLOSER!
- What do people think they'll find if they click on those terms? (see below)
- Do people understand what the site is about? CLOSER!
- Do people understand the glossary indicator? YES!
- What problems are most severe? (see below)


## Participants

- 4 people unfamiliar with USEITI in the following locations: Washington, DC; Minneapolis, MN; and Tucson, AZ


## Let's talk about that global navigation

This was a continuation of the our Sprint-MightyMoose testing cycle. Based on [initial results](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/sprint-mightymoose/sprint-mightymoose_results.md) and [further testing](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/sprint-mightymoose-b/sprint-mightymoose_results-b.md), we adjusted the global navigation in a way we hoped would reduce confusion and improve clarity. The navigation now has two 'levels', with 'utility' links (Downloads, Glossary, and Search) in a less-prominent spot. The 'main' global nav has these options: home, about useiti, how it works, explore data, and case studies. In addition, we tested a new implementation of in-text glossary links.

## About USEITI

People understood what information will be in this section.

_Probably mission statement, purpose, links to staff._

_Information about the program, and about what you guys do._

_I’d expect information about who is responsible for reporting. What the initiative is intended for. I could find information here that would let me understand if this site is relevant for me._

### How it works

Our previous iteration of this navigation found that people were confused about this heading, and sometimes expected information about how USEITI works. We tested adding an additional 'About USEITI' heading to differentiate. This resolved that confusion, and this terms tests clearer, though still does not inspire an immediate 'of course!' response to what might be here.

- _Um, I would expect to see a workflow essentially, I guess? When I see how it works, I’d like to see the processes associated with the oil and gas industry. I’d like a big picture of the entire process._

_Maybe more about how they are managed._

_[Pause] I honestly don’t know at this point. Is this an API? Data? How the mission is being met? How the mission in implemented?_

_[I would expect] An explanation of where their data is coming from._


### Explore Data

The term Explore Data still stayed clear in this iteration, as it was last time. People expected data, and generally expected some sort of ability to interact with data and drill in.

- _Breakdown, interactive data._

- _Um, probably a, um, a database approach. You’d want to be able to quickly be able to get to the data that you’re interested in. Potentially filters. Or kinda clickable data that I’m most interested in._

- _Hey! That one’s fun. It says what I’d expect. Maybe a query builder._


### Case studies

In previous tests, this section was called 'Local Impact,' and people expected ways to reach out to their local political units, or ways to get engaged. This was far more than the actual content in that section, and so we tested a scoped-down word so as not to over-promise.

The expectations with the words 'case studies' were closer to our results, but still broader than we'd like. They do have in common the idea that this is where real-world extractive stories might be, but there is a tendency to expect the case studies to be about how USEITI data is being used, rather than what we actually have, which is just generally how extractives impact communities. Perhaps this is close enough.

- _How the data is being used in the real world, how it being implemented in policy._

- _Ways that this helps certain stakeholders. Whether this is from a public perspective, or from the oil and gas industry. Things that have come out of the work we’re currently doing. Or other international countries and whether they can use this data to help them. Kinda more like quick quotes, how is this helpful._

- _Research backing this._

- _Times when we have been using natural resources as federal revenues._


### Downloads

People seem to be split about whether downloads means data or PDFs/maps/charts.

- _Data for stuff from explore data. Maybe stuff I can print out._

- _Where you get PDFs of graphs or certain graphs or charts._

- _Maybe the relevant guides or different 10 documents that are grouped by, like, data, or introduction. Like various pdfs with written information that’s related._


### Glossary

Our new approach to the glossary seems to be working well! People did not identify it as a point of confusion, and when asked about it specifically were able to understand our intention.

- _Just relevant terms for say a public person without any knowledge of how it works, acronyms. Maybe um….in alphabetical order. I don’t know why, but I’m thinking this._

- _Normally, when I see the dotted line, I think I’m gonna get a [tool]tip -- and I see the word ‘glossary’ on top -- and the little book here next to the line -- so I think I’m right._

- _Define important terms for when you are looking through the data._


## General feedback

Overall, we are ever-closer to a first-glance understanding of what the site is for.

- _This is about natural resources and how they are being used by the government. Map about how much money is spent. An interactive, so you can dive into graphs and data by regions or states._

- _Ummm. Well. The first thing that pops up. I see the logo. Strangely, my eye first went to the oil well because that’s the picture and I like pictures. So I guess the site is about oil and gas._

_I’m reading the tagline and I see the oil graphic [in the carousel] so I’m guessing its about administrating federal oil and gas._

We still see skepticism around the initiative.

- _Ummmm…..primarily for lobbyists or people in industry to evaluate data available in one place, condensed information. Or, research institutions or think thanks -- to come up with new ideas._

- _Ummmm [questioning] it looks like, I was thinking….let’s see, I’m going to go down. It looks like any stakeholder involved in oil and gas. Plus potentially the public._

- _Maybe for the public. Or for people who work for states or counties._

- _People that care about the natural resources of the united states._

We will continue to test this as we add more content to the site.


### What problems were most severe?

With this iteration, there are no severe issues with site navigation that can be tested further. The remaining problems (difficulty with the terms 'How it works' and 'Case studies') may be resolved when the homepage is built out further with content that reinforces what will be in each section of the site.
