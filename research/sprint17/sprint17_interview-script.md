# Template: Onsite User Interview Questions 

Note: This work is based on a template available [here](https://myusa.hackpad.com/Template-Onsite-User-Interview-Questions-y08pqBL0EvA) from the MyUSA team. Thank you, MyUSA!


## Introductory Comments

Brief introduction – share your name and a description of your general duties at 18F.

Very brief discussion of the purpose of today's test:  "My goal today is to get feedback on a new page we're designing. I'm talking to people to get their sense of what this site is all about – what it does, whom it's targeting, where it's clear, where it's unclear, and so on. I really appreciate your taking the time to talk today – your feedback will help us make this site more accessible and easier to use."

Consent: Let participant know that all feedback is anonymous. Provide participant with contact info and let them know that they should feel free to contact you with any questions, comments, or concerns they might have after the test is over. 

Test details: "This interview will be really brief – it should only take between five and ten minutes. I'll ask a few broad questions first, and then show you our site. We're still working on it, so this is more like a Powerpoint online than it is a real website. Not all of it is interactive. Once see the site, I'll ask more directed questions about your experience. I also encourage you to share any other feedback you have at any point during the interview – all feedback is valuable to us."

Questions?: Ask participant if they have any questions. Also let them know that they should feel free to ask questions throughout the process.


## Preliminary Questions

"Before we get started with the site, I'd like to ask you a few general questions about yourself and your Internet usage."

"What is your occupation?"






2. "How many hours a day (or week) do you spend online for yourself – not for work?"






3. "What websites or types of websites do you visit most often? It's OK if you can't remember the names of specific sites – you can just name the type of site you use (e.g., social networking site, news source, personal blog, online banking site, etc.)."







"Awesome – thanks for sharing this information. We’re going to move onto the next part of the interview now. This section is focused on the front page of the website we’re renovating. I'll ask a few broad questions first, and then show you our site. We're still working on it, so again this is more like a Powerpoint online than it is a real website. Not all of it is interactive but you can explore a bit if you like. I'll then ask you to answer some questions."

(Show participant the site, let them explore a little bit.)

"Now that you've seen the some of our site, I'd like you to share your first impressions of it." 
[Jot down notes as interview subject is sharing thoughts.]






"Great! Thank you."


## Main Questions

Here are some questions to ask participants once participants have had a few moments to look at the site:

"Now I'm going to ask some more specific questions about the site. I want to let you know, though, that as you're looking over the site again and answering other questions, you should also feel free to share whatever else you're thinking – there are no right or wrong impressions. The more feedback you can give, the better, so please be as honest as you can – don't hold back!"


1. "OK. First of all, can you tell me (in your own words) what do you think this site is for?" 







2. "Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?"







3. "What's the first thing you notice on this page?"







4. "What would you do if you encountered this page?"







5. "What does this website tell you about the natural resources?"






"We're almost done. For the last part of the interview, I'm going to encourage you to mark up the printed version of the page a bit. [Provide printout.] If you could, please put a question mark next to anything (word, phrase, section, prompt) that you find confusing. Put a plus sign next to anything that makes sense to you but that you'd like more information about. Finally, draw a minus sign next to anything you understand but don't want to read/want less of."

(Observe the interviewee as they mark up the printout, and collect the printout once interviewee has clearly finished marking it up.)

"What other questions do you have about this site, if any?"




## Wrap Up

"Thank you again for taking the time to chat with me today. If you have any follow-up questions, you can always feel free to email me. Last but not least, if you know of anyone else who might be interested in participating, please feel free to put them in touch with me – I'd love to talk to them!"
