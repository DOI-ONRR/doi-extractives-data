# Front page research plan

## Goals / Questions
Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Evaluate front page | Do people understand what the site is about?
 | Can they figure out how to find and navigate stories?
Test terms | Do people understand the term 'extractive resources'?
Prioritize what to fix | What problems are most severe?

## Background

The USEITI beta site uses a long-scroll homepage with various interactive features as you move down. Users did not know they could scroll down, or became so engaged with the first interactive block that they forgot to scroll down later and/or jumped off the front page into other content at that point. Other stories on the site were therefore lost. The new structure attempts to provide more evenly-weighted content blocks that users can flow in and out of easily to match their interests.

In addition, the beta site did not adequately link itself to the USEITI. The new design attempts to provide stronger branding.

### Metrics

* Whether participants understand what the site is about
* Whether participants seem engaged/excited to learn more and click into content
* Whether participants can find content

## Methods
* 10-15 min interview with 18F-ers and Deloitte-ers who are unfamiliar with USEITI
* Notes, no recording
* Remote or in-person

## Script

Original script available [here](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/sprint17/sprint17_interview-script.md). This was revised after a test-run with 18F colleagues that revealed that it was too long for hallway testing (we intend to catch people as they're on their way to somewher else, and so it must be very steamlined). Also, hopefully the revised version is more focused on only the most important things we want to test so that we are sure to get info on those. Revised script [here](https://github.com/18F/doi-extractives-data/blob/research/research/sprint17/sprint17_interview-script-revised.md).
