## Status of our measurable criteria, January 2016

### USEITI 2015 Report is delivered as a wholly online experience with only a short executive summary PDF

We were able to deliver the first version of the USEITI report online. We are not in danger of not meeting the contextual narrative requirements of the international EITI standard and in fact likely have much more information than is required. Our executive summary is longer than we would have liked, but we expect now that a website exists, multi-stakeholder group participants will feel more comfortable making the executive summary a true executive summary in the future because they can see the breadth of what is available online.

One of the remaining sticky wickets to international EITI approval of the USEITI report is around reconciliation data. The international EITI requirements in this area are hard to apply in the US context, both technically and politically. On top of that, the process is complicated and hard to explain (which makes for a confusing website).

For 2016, we should replace this metric and related hypotheses with one that deals with reconciliation content specifically. And truly, this metric can't be completely retired until international EITI officially approves the USEITI Report in 2016.

**Research challenge:**

It can be tricky to balance the EITI requirements with the user needs that research reveals. For example, some of the requirements are very technical and may not register as relevant to users in the U.S., but they must be explained or addressed anyways on the site to make sure the U.S. is approved as an EITI country. We are working to creatively mitigate the impact of these situations on the end user.

### Website views increase

We now have a launched website to baseline this metric against.

### Our site becomes a generally-accepted source of information on this sector; congressional staffers call us or use our site’s information on this sector; both civil society and industry use our site

We have not made progress against these metrics yet, though we now have a live website to publicize (yay!). We will continue working with this in 2016.

## Lessons from user research in 2015

###  How do people feel about transparency and dialogue in the U.S. natural resource revenues system?

We don't know much about this yet. We do know that people tend to come from a place of mistrust. They often want to find out who is sponsoring the site:

- _I always look for the owner._

- _Who are they [USEITI]?_

- _I still want to understand why this [site and initiative] exists._

- _This looks like an industry site._

- _[I expect that the site might] highlight the positive and leave out the negative._

There is some understanding that the site exists to provide access to information that was previously inaccessible. Note, again, that the assumption tends to be that something was incorrect or not shared or previously inadequate, and therefore this initiative was created now.

- _The site is for the public, to give them access to info that isn't easily accessible._

- _The government is trying to figure out what industry is doing with natural resources._

- _Primarily for lobbyists or people in industry to evaluate data available in one place, condensed information._

In terms of dialogue, we didn't get much information that directly related to how people interact with policy. However, when people thought about engaging with the subject area, they expected the ability to contact local officials.

- _Information about talking with local officials somewhere?_

We have a very interesting research problem in our future. The site is about a fairly complex policy area that people should be able to contribute to, but currently is too complicated for non-specialists to easily engage with. Our first version of the site attempts to make information about the policy area easier to understand, but the question still remains: what is the best way to promote dialogue in this area? How do people wish to be engaged? This problem (complexity plus public engagement without intense time commitment or specialist background) is common to many areas of public policy. The research we do here will hopefully be of use to other projects as well.

### How is trust and dialogue between natural resource sectors going? (industry, civil society and government)

Our previous research didn't reveal anything about this desired outcome.

### General user research notes

#### Interest in local information

Local impact seems to be broadly interesting to folks (potentially because it gives them a place to start and/or relates to their concerns and priorities):

> Are we talking about digging, like environmental impact? Or the money coming back to communities from extraction?

> The view of the map makes me think that I can drill in and get specific. Of course the first thing I’d want to do it see where I am, see my local area.

> I could click on a specific region. If I’m from MN, I could see what is happening in MN.

> I would expect to see something where I might be involved. How can I find out what’s going on where I live, or where my parents live? In journalism speak, that’s where I would think the engagement might be. Maybe some call to action, how can I explore more, who should I contact in my local county.

> I would want to learn more about the impact on my community.

#### Language and usability

- "Initiative" was a confusing word for several users
- "Civil society" was a confusing term for many people
- "Natural resources" was unclear, particularly as a navigation item
- People expressed relief and comprehension when they saw familiar words like "oil," "gas," etc.
- Users consistently look for the _who_ behind the site — they expect it to be biased based on who created it.
- We need to spell out EITI on the homepage — people don't get the full name clearly from the logo alone.
- Glossary icon was confusing as a stand-alone nav item; including the word "glossary" seemed to help clarify.

#### Risks highlighted by users

- Danger of people thinking the site was developed by/for industry (they expect bias as a result of industry, or "corporate" involvement)
- Users are suspicious that the site might only "highlight the positive" — we need to build trust that it's neutral.
- At least one user was confused about land ownership and property rights (before reading site content; we don't have data on whether the "How it works" content reduces this confusion).
- Users were confused about what to do on the site or where to start.
