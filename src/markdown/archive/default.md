      <h2 id="history">History</h2>
      <p>The U.S. announced its intention to join the <a href="https://eiti.org/">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)</a> in 2011 as part of its <a href="https://www.opengovpartnership.org/">Open Government Partnership National Action Plans</a>. EITI is a voluntary, international standard that promotes open and accountable management of natural resources.</p>
      <p>The USEITI Annual Reports for 2015 and 2016 were published on this site as <a href="/explore/">interactive data</a>, along with <a href="/archive/report">Executive Summaries</a>. Participation in the EITI helped the U.S. initiate a comprehensive open data effort around natural resource production and revenue generation on public lands.</p>
      <p>In November 2017, the U.S. decided to no longer formally implement the <glossary-term>EITI Standard</glossary-term>.</p>
      <p>DOI is fully committed to institutionalizing the EITI principles of transparency and accountability, supported by the robust <a href="/archive/audits-and-assurances/">controls and assurances</a> already in place in the U.S. This site is now a DOI resource for extractive industry data. We will continue to disclose revenue payments received for extractive operations on federal land, offer production data, report annual disbursements, and improve reporting by including additional states and tribes.</p>
