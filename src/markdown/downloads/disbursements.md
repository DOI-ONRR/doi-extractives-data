## Scope

This dataset includes natural resource disbursements for U.S. federal lands, federal offshore areas, and Native American lands. It does not include privately owned lands or U.S. state lands. The dataset is tracked and managed by the Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue. It contains disbursement information to funds for fiscal years 2003-2018. Disbursements of revenue from extractive activities on U.S. federal lands occur monthly; this dataset is a sum of those disbursements by fiscal year.

## Data publication

The disbursement dataset is updated in November after the end of the federal government fiscal year.

### Fields and Definitions
Laws treat revenues from offshore natural resources and onshore natural resources differently. There are set percentages and amounts from each that go to specific funds, local governments, or government agencies. All revenue collected from Native American lands is disbursed back to Native American tribes, nations, or individuals.

_Fiscal Year_ The year the disbursement occurred. The federal fiscal year runs from October 1 of the prior year through September 30 of the year being described. For example, Fiscal Year 2018 is between October 1, 2017,  and September 30, 2018.

_Fund Type_ The type of recipient receiving the disbursement.

* _U.S. Treasury_ Funds disbursed to the Treasury go to the General Fund, which is the federal government’s basic operating fund. The General Fund pays for roughly two-thirds of all federal expenditures, including the U.S. military, national parks, and schools.
* _U.S. Treasury GoMESA_ The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) of 2006 specifies that 50% of revenues from certain gulf leases be directed to the U.S. Treasury.
* _American Indian Tribes_ ONRR disburses 100% of revenue collected from resource extraction on Native American lands back to Native American tribes, nations, and individuals.
* _Land and Water Conservation_ Fund This fund provides matching grants to states and local governments to buy and develop public outdoor recreation areas across the 50 states.
* _Land and Water Conservation Fund GoMESA_ The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) of 2006 specifies that 12.5% of revenues from certain gulf leases be directed to the LWCF stateside program. States can receive up to $125 million a year in funding. This portion of LWCF funds is not subject to the congressional appropriation process, but are otherwise treated similarly to regular LWCF funds.
* _Historic Preservation Fund_ This fund helps preserve U.S. historical and archaeological sites and cultural heritage through grants to state and tribal historic preservation offices.
* _Reclamation Fund_ Established by Congress in 1902 to pay for Bureau of Reclamation projects, this fund supports the establishment of critical infrastructure projects like dams and power plants.
* _State_ Funds disbursed to states fall under the jurisdiction of each state, and each state determines how the funds will be used.
* _State 8(g)_ 27% of revenue from leases in the 8(g) Zone (the first three nautical miles of the Outer Continental Shelf) are shared with states.
* _State GoMESA_ 37.5% of revenue from certain leases in the Gulf of Mexico are shared with Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.
* _Other_ Certain funds are directed back to the federal agencies that administer these lands (e.g., BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Forest Service) to help cover the agencies’ operational costs. The Ultra-Deepwater Research Program and the Mescal Settlement Agreement also receive $50 million each.

_Onshore/Offshore_ Whether the origin of the revenue being disbursed is offshore or onshore.

_State_ The state that received the disbursement in accordance with revenue-sharing legislation.

_County_ The county that received the disbursement in accordance with revenue-sharing legislation.

_Total_ The total amount disbursed.
