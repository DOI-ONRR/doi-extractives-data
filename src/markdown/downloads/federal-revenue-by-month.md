## Scope

This dataset includes revenues paid by companies to extract natural resources on U.S. federal lands and waters. It also includes revenues generated on Native American tribal and individual lands. It does not include privately owned lands or state lands. The dataset includes data tracked and managed by the Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue. The data is presented by month, from January 2008 through the most recently completed month (we update the data every month).

<h3 alt="Negative values">Why are some values negative?</h3>

Companies can adjust and correct their payments for up to seven years after a transaction takes place. If a company overpays their royalty, rent, or bonus, they are entitled to recover their overpayment. If the overpayment and recovered payment happen in different years, the recovered payment will appear as a negative amount in the data.

<h3 alt="Oil and gas values">Why is there a Gas value, an Oil value and an Oil & Gas value?</h3>

“Oil & Gas” is the commodity category used for offshore oil and gas rents and bonuses. At the time of lease sale, it isn’t known whether a lease will produce oil, gas or both oil and gas. After a lease starts producing a commodity (or commodities), the lease owner starts paying royalties. These can then be associated with either oil or gas. Hence, rent and bonus lines of data will be associated with an “Oil & Gas” commodity type, while royalty lines of data will be associated with either “Oil” or “Gas” commodity types.

### Fields and definitions

_Month_ The month the revenue was collected by ONRR.

_Calendar Year_ The calendar year for the month the revenue was collected by ONRR.

_Land Class_ This field distinguishes federal lands and waters from Native American lands.

_Land Category_ This field distinguishes between onshore and offshore revenue. Some revenues – such as civil penalties – are not tied to either onshore or offshore.

_Revenue Type_ Revenues from U.S. natural resources fall into one of several types:

* _Royalties_ A natural resource lease holder pays royalties after the lease starts producing a commodity in <glossary-term>paying quantities</glossary-term>. The amount is based on a percentage of the revenue from the commodity sold. The exact percentage is set in the original lease document that went along with the lease sale.
* _Bonus_ The amount paid by the highest successful bidder for a natural resource lease. The winning bid.
* _Rents_ A natural resource lease might not produce anything in paying quantities for some time after it is sold. Until it does, periodic payments are made for the right to continue exploration and development of the land for future natural resource production. These payments are called rent.
