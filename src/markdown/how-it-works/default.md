      <p class="ribbon-hero-description">In the U.S., land and the resources beneath it can be owned by private individuals and corporations or by federal, state, local, and Native American governments. This makes the U.S. different from nearly every other country; in many places oil, gas, coal, and other minerals simply belong to the government, but in the U.S. there is widespread private ownership of these resources.</p>
