    For a detailed view of how oil extraction affects communities in Alaska, read the [North Slope Borough case study](/archive/case-studies/north-slope/).

state_optin_intro: |
    To understand the extractive industries in Alaska, learn about Alaska's unique [land ownership](#understanding-land-ownership), [trust funds](#saving-and-spending), and [revenue sustainability considerations](#revenue-sustainability).
state_production: |
    Most of Alaska's crude oil production takes place in the [North Slope Borough](/archive/case-studies/north-slope/), where exploration, drilling, and transportation costs are high, but high volume and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline make commercial drilling feasible.

    About three-fourths of Alaska's natural gas withdrawals are consumed on site after extraction, because it is not commercially feasible to transport to distant markets. For more information about the Alaska Natural Gas pipeline, see the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's [Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects](https://www.ferc.gov/industries/gas/indus-act/angtp.asp).

    **Nonenergy minerals:** For details about nonenergy mineral extraction, see the [USGS Minerals Yearbook for Alaska](http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/state/ak.html).

    In 2013, Alaska's nonenergy mineral production was valued at about $3.55 billion. Metals, including gold, made up 98% of Alaska’s nonenergy mineral production value in 2013. Alaska produces 14% of U.S. gold, with major gold mines in central Alaska, southern Alaska, and the Seward Peninsula.

state_land_production: |
    We don't have detailed data about production of natural resources on land owned by the state of Alaska. See [state governance](#state-governance) for information about governance of state land.
state_revenue: |
    Alaska relies on revenue from natural resource extraction on federal, state, and private land as a primary source of income for the state.

    Alaska collects oil and gas production taxes and royalties based on the assessed value of the gross product, resulting in revenues sensitive to price fluctuations.

    Alaska deducts property taxes paid to municipalities from the amount owed in state taxes. The state collects and retains all property taxes assessed on <glossary-term termKey="unorganized land">unorganized lands</glossary-term>. In 2016, unorganized territory petroleum property taxes totaled $60.4 million, or 54% of the total petroleum property taxes collected by the state.
state_revenue_sustainability: |
    ![Alaska revenues compared to Alaska revenues from oil and gas for 2010-2018. 2016-18 figures are projected. Total state revenues were highest in 2011, at nearly $20 billion, and ranged from $13.5 billion to $19.5 billion between 2012 and 2014 before dropping to just under $9 billion in 2015. The total petroleum based revenue amount rose from just over $6 billion in 2010 to $10 billion in 2012, then fell steadily to under $3 billion in 2015. For 2016-2018, revenues from petroleum based revenue is projected to drop to about $1.5 billion, then rise to just under $2 billion, while total revenues are expected to rise steadily to just under $11 billion. The average price of oil is listed under the chart for context. The price of oil was highest in 2011 and 2012, at $99 per barrel, and lowest in 2015, when it dropped to just $41.](/public/img/AK_revenue_sustainability.svg)

    In 2016, oil and gas revenue streams contributed $1.6 billion to Alaska general fund revenues and accounted for 28% of Alaska’s total revenue.

    Increased oil prices in the early 2010’s caused a spike in annual revenue in Alaska, and the drop in crude oil prices in late 2014 caused a significant decline in the state’s petroleum-related revenue streams. Oil and gas revenue declined by over 30% between fiscal years 2015 and 2016, and the Alaska tax division predicts that oil and gas revenue will continue to decline to between 15% and 17% of total state revenues in the coming years.

    Between fiscal years 2014 and 2015, Alaska’s total revenue declined by more than 50% (from $17.2 billion to $8.6 billion), and between fiscal years 2015 and 2016, total revenue declined again by more than 30% (from $8.6 billion to $5.8 billion). Oil and gas revenues generally account for around 75% of the state’s unrestricted budget, so declining prices had an even greater impact on the state’s discretionary budget than on programs with dedicated funds from federal or other sources.

    To learn more about Alaska’s recent budget shortfalls due to the decline in oil revenue:

    * Alaska’s [2014 budget summary (PDF)](https://www.omb.alaska.gov/ombfiles/15_budget/PDFs/15Enacted_Fiscal_Summary.pdf)
    * [Working Together to Close the Gap (PDF)](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/documentviewer/viewer.aspx?1240r) has a special chapter on “Bridging the Gap Toward a Sustainable Fiscal Future”

    Because this issue is shared by many parts of the world with significant natural resource revenues, the International Monetary Fund produced a report in 2015 called [The Commodities Roller Coaster: A Fiscal Framework for Uncertain Times (PDF)](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fm/2015/02/pdf/fm1502.pdf).
state_tax_expenditures: |
    Alaska had four tax expenditures claimed in 2016 that were directly related to oil and gas extraction and totaled at least $1 million each. Together, these four tax expenditures reduced state or local revenue by a total of $580 million. The expenditure credits and per taxable barrel credits each accounted for 95% of total expenditures, at $495 million and $56 million respectively. The Alaska Department of Revenue outlines tax expenditures in its [Revenue Sources Book (PDF)](http://tax.alaska.gov/programs/documentviewer/viewer.aspx?1321r).
state_disbursements: |
    [State agencies](#state-agencies) distribute revenues according to [Alaska law](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/folio.asp), which is defined by the legislature. See Alaska's [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.omb.alaska.gov/) for budget priorities and details.
state_saving_spending: |
    The state of Alaska saves about 37% of royalties and 27% of production taxes. (Royalties, production taxes, and property taxes are Alaska’s three largest sources of revenue from natural resource extraction.) Most of Alaska’s saved revenue goes to one of these funds:

    **The [Alaska Permanent Fund](http://www.apfc.org/home/Content/home/index.cfm) (APF)** is a permanent natural resource trust fund used to pay citizen dividends, manage inflation, and support the general fund. The Alaska constitution requires that 25% of mineral-related income and any additional legislative appropriations be placed in the APF. In August 2017, the fund’s market value was $60 billion.

    Alaska citizens receive annual dividends from the APF. In response to budget conditions, the Governor of Alaska exercised his line-item veto power to [cut the total dividend payout](http://gov.alaska.gov/newsroom/2016/06/governor-walker-vetoes-1-29-billion-to-preserve-state-savings/) to $650 million, which reduced individual checks to $1,022 for each of its 635,997 eligible residents in 2016. This is down from $2,072 in 2015, and also below the ten-year average payout of $1,424.

    To learn more, see the APF Dividend Division's [annual reports](https://pfd.alaska.gov/Division-Info/Annual-Reports) or [financial history and projections (PDF)](https://apfc.org/report-archive/#41-history-and-projections).

    **The [Public School Trust Fund](http://treasury.dor.alaska.gov/Investments/Public-School-Trust-Funds.aspx)** is worth $641 million (as of July 31, 2017), and funded by 0.5% of state receipts from the management of all state lands. The public school system has access to $8 million from the fund, while the fund retains the principal and some net income.

    **The [Constitutional Budget Reserve Fund](http://treasury.dor.alaska.gov/Investments/Constitutional-Budget-Reserve.aspx)** was created in 1990 to hold money received by the state from mineral disputes. It grew from $1.8 billion in 2006 to $10.1 billion in 2015. The fund is now worth $3.9 billion (as of July 31, 2017). Under certain conditions, the Alaska State Legislature may use it to fund state government operations.
state_impact: |
    The extractive industries play an important role in Alaska’s economy. Pipeline transportation and construction also contribute significantly; in 2014, pipeline transportation contributed $4.1 billion to Alaska's GDP.

    Because of relatively high annual wages (compared to other industries), extractive industries contribute a greater percentage of personal income than other jobs. In 2016, annual wages from extractive industries made up about 14% (or $1.8 billion) of total annual wages in the state. The average annual wage for extractive-industry jobs in Alaska in 2016 was $128,912, or more than twice the statewide average wage of $52,343.

### Understanding land ownership

Land ownership in Alaska is unique among states. When the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, the federal government initially owned all 375 million acres of the Alaska Territory. When Alaska became a state 92 years later, in 1959, the federal government granted 28% of the land to the state through a process that was unique to Alaska. The state selected 103 million acres of land and was granted an additional 1.2 million acres in trust lands; Alaska also owns all mineral rights in its acreage.

The state of Alaska is the second largest landowner in the state (after the U.S. government). It received patent to 90 million of the acres it selected. Some of the areas the state selected have not yet been transferred from the federal government. Learn more about:

* [Leasing state land (PDF)](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/factsht/land_fs/lease_land.pdf)
* [Buying state land (PDF)](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/factsht/land_fs/landsales_process.pdf)
* [State land sales](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/landsale/index.cfm)
* [Land for Alaskans program (PDF)](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/factsht/land_fs/land_for_ak.pdf)

The Alaska Mental Health Trust also owns and manages 1 million acres with significant timber, oil, gas, coal, or material resources. Revenues from lands managed by the Trust support mental health programs in the state.

To explore a map of land ownership in Alaska, see the Alaska Department of Natural Resource’s [mapping application](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mapper/controller?gsid=69485D2AB203DA17B904B273F696CE72.tomcat-90).

#### Alaska Native corporations

In most states, American Indian land was taken by force, settled by treaty, or both — but in Alaska, Native claims to land were not settled or resolved until Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1971. ANCSA granted 44 million acres (both surface and sub-surface) and 1 billion dollars to 12 regional native corporations and 220 village corporations. These village and regional corporations now own 12% of land in Alaska; non-native private lands in Alaska make up just 1% of the land in the state.

These private, for-profit corporations belong to and benefit Alaska Natives in their region or village, but are distinct from tribes. Alaska Natives were allotted shares in Alaska Native corporations when the corporations were created. Unlike shares in a publicly traded corporation, however, Alaska Native corporation shares cannot be traded or sold.

Alaska Native corporations have generated substantial revenues from resource development, though this exposes them to the same revenue sustainability questions that affect [state revenues](#revenue-sustainability). ANCSA provides for natural revenue sharing among all ANCs, so ANCs may mutually support each other to help smooth revenue volatility: For example, the [Red Dog zinc mine](http://www.nana.com/regional/resources/red-dog-mine/) has generated $1.3 billion in net proceeds for NANA Regional Corporation since mining began. It has retained about $480 million and shared about $820 million with other ANCs. Of the $480 million retained, about $221 million has been paid out to individual shareholders as dividends.

Separately from the Alaska Native corporations, there are [229 federally recognized tribal entities](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/01/29/2016-01769/indian-entities-recognized-and-eligible-to-receive-services-from-the-united-states-bureau-of-indian#h-7) in Alaska. Until recently, they were viewed as landless (with the exception of one reservation, the Metlakatla Indian Community’s Annette Island Reserve). The Bureau of Indian Affairs recently changed this by establishing [Rule 25 CFR Part 151](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title25-vol1/pdf/CFR-2012-title25-vol1-part151.pdf), which allows Alaska tribes to apply to put land into trust.

### State agencies

Alaska state agencies regulate extraction and interact with extractive industry companies in Alaska, particularly when they're operating on state or private land.

The [Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission](http://doa.alaska.gov/ogc/WhoWeAre/welcome.html) leads monitoring, enforcement, and restoration activities to support responsible stewardship of Alaska’s oil and gas resources. Its responsibilities include:

* Evaluating and approving drilling operations
* Preventing oil and gas waste at drill sites where the majority of natural gas extraction is flared
* Preventing freshwater contamination throughout drilling
* Administering Alaska’s Underground Injection Control Program
* Inspecting oil field drilling, projecting, metering, and abandonment activities
* Publishing a [competitiveness report](http://dor.alaska.gov/Portals/5/Alaska's%20Oil%20and%20Gas%20Competitiveness%20Report%202015.pdf) and [annual reports](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/programs/reports/AnnualReport.aspx?Year=2016)

The [Alaska Department of Natural Resources](http://dnr.alaska.gov/) manages Alaska's natural resources and extraction on state land.

The [Division of Oil and Gas](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/) is responsible for leasing state lands for oil, gas, and geothermal extraction. It publishes [studies](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/Information/Studies), and its activities include:

* Identifying prospective lease areas; evaluating oil and gas resources; and performing geologic, economic, environmental, and social analyses
* Fielding and issuing exploration permits, developing leasing schedules, and conducting public review of proposed sales
* Conducting oil and gas lease sales, negotiating contracts, and conducting royalty audits
* Decommissioning, removal, and restoration regulatory review
- Publishing statutes and regulations governing [oil and gas, and geothermal](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/About/Regulations)
- Publishing data about [oil and gas funds received and distributed](http://dog.dnr.alaska.gov/Information/Data)

The [Mining, Land, and Water Division](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/) is the primary manager of Alaska’s land holdings, which are larger by area than any other state, and Alaska's mineral resources (excluding oil, gas, coalbed methane, and geothermal energy). It is responsible for:

* Managing state mineral exploration, development and leasing programs on 96 million acres of state lands available for exploration
* Planning, leasing, and permitting industrial use mines
* Administering the [Surface Coal Mining Control and Reclamation Program](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/coal/)
* Administering the [Abandoned Mine Land Program](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/aml/), which regulates surface mines and mining <glossary-term>reclamation</glossary-term> activities (in 2014, there were 23 sites awaiting reclamation)
* Overseeing major land development project authorizations like the North Slope
* Publishing information on [Public Land Titles](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/title/index.cfm) and [State Land Sales](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/landsale/index.cfm)
* Publishing Alaska’s [mineral development policies (PDF)](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/AK_MineralPolicy.pdf), [mining factsheets](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/factsht/), and [mining regulations](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/sb175.pdf)

The [Alaska Department of Revenue](http://dor.alaska.gov/) assesses, collects, manages, and distributes the majority of extractives revenues in Alaska.

The [Alaska Department of Revenue](http://dor.alaska.gov/) collects revenue from companies engaged in extraction, with verification from the Oil and Gas Division, and publishes an [Annual Report](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/programs/reports/AnnualReport.aspx?Year=2016) and [Revenue Sources Book (PDF)](http://tax.alaska.gov/programs/documentviewer/viewer.aspx?1321r).

* The [Alaska Department of Revenue Tax Division](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/) collects state taxes, including the Oil and Gas Production Tax and Oil and Gas Property Tax, and administers tax laws.
  - [Tax Division reports](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/reports.aspx)
  - [Revenue sources and forecast information](http://www.tax.alaska.gov/programs/sourcebook/index.aspx)

The Environmental Conservation’s Program [Spill Prevention and Response Division](http://dec.alaska.gov/spar/index.htm) (SPAR) prevents spills of oil, prepares for when a spill occurs, and responds rapidly to protect human health and the environment.

#### Local governance in Alaska

Alaska has two [local government structures (PDF)](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/Portals/4/pub/2015%20%20LOCAL%20GOVERNMENT%20IN%20ALASKA.pdf): cities and boroughs. All local governments in Alaska enjoy broad powers, but some cities and boroughs are [home rule municipalities  (PDF)](https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/Portals/4/pub/Homerule.pdf), which have the right to “exercise all legislative powers not prohibited by law or by charter.”

### Fiscal costs of extractive activity

In addition to generating [revenue](#revenue) and [economic activity](#economic-impact), extractive industries can bring costs to state and local communities. Development and activity related to the extractive industries are concentrated on Alaska's northern coast, so attention to costs is concentrated in that part of the state.

For a holistic look at how the North Slope Borough has met the transportation, water, emergency services, and reclamation needs of extractive industries, see [the North Slope Borough case study](/archive/case-studies/north-slope/#costs).

Multiple organizations in the Alaska state government work on the reclamation and remediation of sites related to extraction. The Alaska state government invests significant tax dollars to prevent and respond to oil and hazardous substance emergencies, including reclamation services such as managing contaminated drilling sites. The [Oil and Hazardous Substance Release Prevention and Response Fund](https://dec.alaska.gov/spar/rfa/history.htm) imposes a 4 cent surcharge per barrel of oil for prevention, and a 1 cent surcharge per barrel of oil for response. The [Division of Spill Prevention and Response (SPAR)](https://dec.alaska.gov/spar/) had a total operating budget of $19.9 million in fiscal year 2016. $12.3 million of that went to spill prevention and response in fiscal year 2016.

The DNR Mining, Land, and Water’s [Abandoned Mine Lands Program](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/aml/) administers the federal AML program in Alaska for coal and select hard rock reclamation projects. The program estimated in May of 2014 that 15 coal projects and 8 non-coal projects remained to be reclaimed. Alaska is a Minimum Program state, meaning it receives $3 million a year from the [federal Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation program](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/aml/), with the funds coming from fees paid by current coal mine operators. [See examples of AML projects](http://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/mining/aml/).
