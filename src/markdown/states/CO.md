state_land: |
  The state of Colorado covers over 66.5 million acres. The state is the owner and steward of 2.8 million acres of land and 4 million acres of mineral rights. In total, it owns 4% of land in Colorado, making it the state’s second-largest landowner, just behind the federal government.
state_land_production: |
  The state of Colorado does not publish data about natural resource production on state lands. To obtain this data, contact the [Colorado State Land Board](https://colorado.gov/statelandboard).
state_revenue: |
  State and local governments in Colorado collect or receive revenue from natural resource extraction on federal, state, and private lands.
state_revenue_sustainability: |
  In FY2016, natural resource revenue accounted for 0.89% of total revenue collected by the Colorado Department of Revenue. Colorado has a diverse set of revenue streams; however, the downturn of oil and gas markets in 2016 did have a substantial impact on certain government funds. The State Land Board, for example, saw its total trust revenue decrease by 28% due to a 35% decrease in mineral revenues.
state_tax_expenditures: |
  In FY2015, Colorado had 15 tax expenditures directly related to the extractive industries which reduced state and local revenue. Data on the exact revenue impact for all expenditures is largely unavailable due to confidentiality requirements or inability to collect that information, however, the Oil and Gas Ad Valorem Credit had an impact of $134,915,000. The Colorado Department of Revenue outlines tax expenditures in its annual [Tax Profile and Expenditure Report (PDF)](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/2016%20Tax%20Profile%20and%20Expenditure%20Report.pdf).
state_disbursements: |
  State agencies distribute revenue according to the [Colorado State Code](https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/Welcome.do). In addition to receiving distributions from the state, counties also collect and distribute revenue from local taxes, chiefly property taxes. Weld County, for example, produces the most oil and gas in the state, and generates a significant portion of its property tax revenue from oil and gas. It then disburses this revenue to help fund local schools, fire departments, libraries, towns, and water districts, among other items. For more details on how Weld County disburses property tax revenue see the county’s [distribution statements and treasurer reports](https://www.weldgov.com/cms/One.aspx?portalId=169&pageId=2451).
state_saving_spending: |
  Many states choose to establish permanent mineral trust funds, which can help governments smooth revenue and investments across boom and bust cycles. In FY2016, Colorado saved 28.05% of total state revenue from extractive activities. In a given year, most of Colorado’s saved extractive revenues goes to one of these funds:

  * **Local Government Permanent Fund**: Money in this fund cannot be used for any purpose except when the amount of Federal Mineral Lease revenue is 10% less than the amount received the previous year.
  * **Higher Education Maintenance and Reserve Fund**: The interest and income earned on this fund is used for maintenance projects controlled by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education’s Capital Improvements Program. The principal in this fund must remain unused unless General Fund revenue is projected to dip below the required 4% reserve.
  * **School Trust Permanent Fund**: Colorado created this fund at statehood. Interest generated on the principal must support K-12 education. Interest earnings of the fund are credited to the Public School Income Fund and transferred to the Colorado Department of Education.

  See the [Memorandum on Allocation of Severance Taxes (PDF)](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/Allocation%20of%20Severance%20Taxes.pdf) or [Public School Permanent Fund Investment Policy (PDF)](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Public%20School%20Permanent%20Fund%202010%20Investment%20Policy%20-%20Approved%20March%2015%202017.pdf) for more detail.

### State agencies

The state of Colorado regulates an array of activities related to natural resource extraction and interacts with the extractive industries, especially when the activity is occurring on state or private land.

The [Colorado Department of Revenue](https://www.colorado.gov/revenue) collects, manages, and distributes revenue from companies engaged in extraction in Colorado. It publishes annual [summary](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/annual-report) , [expenditure (PDF)](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/2016%20Tax%20Profile%20and%20Expenditure%20Report.pdf), and [severance tax](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/tax/severance-tax-file) reports. Additionally, county governments collect oil and gas related property taxes, with the [Colorado Department of Local Affairs](https://www.colorado.gov/dola)’ [Division of Property Taxation](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dola/property-taxation) coordinating this process.

The [Colorado Department of Natural Resources](http://dnr.state.co.us/Pages/DNRDefault.aspx) manages the state’s natural resources and administers [state trust lands](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/statelandboard).

* The Colorado [Oil and Gas Conservation Commission](http://cogcc.state.co.us/#/home) ensures that oil and gas wells and operations comply with state law. It is involved in all stages of extraction—issuing exploration permits, auctioning leases, addressing incidents/complaints, enforcing rules and regulations, collecting levies, etc. The commission is governed by [rules and regulations](http://cogcc.state.co.us/#/overview), runs a [data portal](http://cogcc.state.co.us/data.html#/cogis), and publishes [reports](http://cogcc.state.co.us/library.html#/areareports).
* The [Division of Reclamation, Mining, and Safety](http://mining.state.co.us/Pages/Home.aspx) works to protect the public, miners, and the environment during current mining operations. It holds responsibility for restoring abandoned mines and ensuring that all mined land is reclaimed to beneficial use. It works to achieve these goals through [four major programs](http://mining.state.co.us/PROGRAMS/Pages/default.aspx): coal regulatory program, minerals regulatory program, inactive mine reclamation program, and mine safety and training program. The commission is governed by [rules and regulations](http://mining.state.co.us/Rules/Pages/home.aspx) and publishes [data and reports](http://mining.state.co.us/Reports/Pages/default.aspx)

The [Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe) (CDPHE) plays a role in regulating oil and gas operations. CDPHE deals primarily with:
* [Air emission](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/emissions-requirements-oil-and-gas-industry) requirements for the oil and gas industry
* [Water quality](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/categories/services-and-information/environment/water-quality) and stormwater discharge permits for oil and gas facilities
* [Hazardous, radioactive, and solid waste](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/categories/services-and-information/environment/waste-management-and-recycling) requirements affecting oil and gas facilities
* [Climate change](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/categories/services-and-information/environment/air-quality/climate-change) and greenhouse gases through mandatory reporting rules, reports, and presentations
* [Public health](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/categories/services-and-information/environment/oil-and-gas/oil-and-gas-and-your-health) effects from oil and gas operations through reporting, community investigations, and assessments

### State laws and regulations

The Colorado Constitution includes Article XVI on Mining and Irrigation, which outlines laws regulating the safety and environmental implications of extraction as well as the organizational structure charged with overseeing extractive activities.

The [Code of Colorado Regulations](https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/KeywordSearch.do) also has several sections that govern natural resource extraction, including:

- [Practice and Procedure (PDF)](https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/GenerateRulePdf.do?ruleVersionId=6658) (2 CCR 404-1) outlines rules and regulations to prevent waste and conserve oil and gas in the state of Colorado, while protecting public health, safety, welfare, including the environment and wildlife resources
- [Hard Rock Metal Mining (PDF)](https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/GenerateRulePdf.do?ruleVersionId=6169) (2 CCR 407-1) includes general provisions and requirements regarding the permit process
- [Regulations for Coal Mining (PDF)](https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/GenerateRulePdf.do?ruleVersionId=2044) (2CCR 407-2) establishes the provision known as the Colorado Surface Coal Mining Reclamation Act
- [Control of Hazardous Air Pollutants (PDF)](https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/GenerateRulePdf.do?ruleVersionId=6885) (5 CCR 1001-10) regulates all new sources of air pollution and all modified or reconstructed sources of air pollution, including those generated by the extraction industry
- [Storage Tank Regulations (PDF)](https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/GenerateRulePdf.do?ruleVersionId=7122) (7 CCR 1101-14) outlines rules for the design, installation, registration, construction and operation of storage tanks used to store regulated substances (including petroleum)
- [Rules Regarding Electric Utilities (PDF)](https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/GenerateRulePdf.do?ruleVersionId=7016) (4 CCR 723-3) describes the specific provisions applicable to public utilities, includes specific regulations related to renewable energy, and recognizes that is it in the best interest of the public to utilize and develop renewable energy resources

### Fiscal costs of extractive activity

In addition to generating [revenue](#revenue) and [economic activity](#economic-impact), extractive industries can also bring certain costs to state and local communities. In Colorado, these are concentrated in a few areas due to the fact that nearly all production occurs in just six counties: Weld, Garfield, La Plata, Adams, Rio Blanco, and Jackson. Attention to and analysis of costs is, therefore, focused on these areas.

#### Transportation costs

Extractive activities have resulted in not only more traffic on Colorado roads and highways, but also greater loads on the state’s transportation infrastructure. In certain areas, such as Highway 85C between Fort Lupton and Platteville, traffic has increased by 58.72% over a five year period due to oil and gas development. Additionally, according to a Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) study, the load impact of trucks used in extraction can be as much as 15,000 to 46,000 times that of a passenger car. Oil and gas loads are estimated to be 3-10% of total loads on the Colorado highway system.

According to CDOT, the estimated cost to offset the impact of the oil and gas extraction on state roads and highways ranges from $10 to $30 million, which is up to 13% of the CDOT’s annual surface treatment budget. To read more, see the CDOT study [Oil and Gas Impacts on Transportation (PDF)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiu64Ojv67UAhVB0iYKHWJUDTIQFggoMAA&url=https://www.codot.gov/programs/research/pdfs/2015-research-reports/oil-and-gas-impacts-on-tranportation/oil-and-gas-impacts-on-transportation/at_download/file&usg=AFQjCNGVRJ978GbLquZkhv6I6g-zS1BWpQ&sig2=bITCLpAOHH8hUzqce_tPIA_).

#### Water costs

Increased extraction can put added demand on both water supplies and water infrastructure in communities. This can lead to increased rates and the need for infrastructure investments. Oil and gas extraction in Colorado reported using approximately 6.7 billion gallons of water from 2011-2013. Additionally, COGCC found that extractive activities produced 304,451,972 BBL of water in 2016, 0.006% of which was spilled.

In addition to water use and production, the environmental and engineering staff of the COGCC also monitor and assess water quality in Colorado. Currently, they are investigating 22 instances of Thermogenic stray gas impacts in domestic water wells in the Denver-Julesberg basin. Additionally, the state, through the Department of Public Health and Environment, also has multiple large remediation obligations related to the extractive industry, including a total of: $57 million at Summerville Mine operating a water treatment plant, $64.8 million at Clear Creek Basin cleaning up metal mine contaminated surface water, and $5.5 million at Captain Jack Mill addressing mine waste piles and drainage. See Colorado’s [Comprehensive Annual Report](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/osc/cafr) to read more about the state’s remediation obligations.

#### Emergency services

The increased population that often corresponds with increased extraction can place greater demands on the emergency medical, fire, and police services of the state, counties, and towns.

Notably, a [study conducted on the extractive industry]() in Weld County found a 163% increase in large truck crashes and a 64% increase in fatal crashes between 2000 and 2014 (a time of major growth in active wells in the area).
Additionally, increased extractive activity has also led to increased oil and gas fires and explosions. Though the exact number of such incidents is not published by the government, general incidents and complaints can be searched through the [Colorado Oil and Gas Information System](http://cogcc.state.co.us/data.html). Additionally, a study conducted in 2005 found 32 incidents of active coal mine fires.

#### Reclamation costs

Multiple organizations in the Colorado state government work on the reclamation and remediation of sites related to extraction.

The Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission oversees spill incidents associated with oil and gas exploration and production related activities. The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment’s Division of Oil and Public Safety oversees cleanup of petroleum released from regulated underground storage tanks. Finally, the Colorado Department of Transportation oversees spill incidents within Colorado highways and beyond.

Colorado has not been “certified” by the federal [Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation program](/how-it-works/aml-reclamation-program/), meaning that it has remaining high-priority abandoned coal mine areas. Reclamation efforts in Colorado are led by the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining, and Safety (DRMS) which works to reclaim [abandoned](http://mining.state.co.us/Reports/Reports/Pages/AML.aspx) and [inactive](http://mining.state.co.us/Programs/Abandoned/Pages/impwelcomepage.aspx) mines. DRMS has reclaimed 6,127 of the estimated 23,000 abandoned mines in Colorado. In 2017, Colorado received $2,793,000 from the federal AML Program, sourced from fees paid by coal mine operators, in line with the historic annual average. The average cost for closing a hazardous abandoned mine feature is $5,000. An [overview of DRMS’ history and work can be found here](http://mining.state.co.us/Programs/Abandoned/Reclamation/Pages/OurProgram'sHistory-Colorado'sHistory.aspx).

Colorado currently has $75.3 million in unfunded abandoned mine land areas in need of reclamation. Priority 1 abandoned mine land (AML) areas, the highest priority, account for $41.5 million (or 55.2%) of those unfunded costs. Priority 1 AML areas are those that are necessary to reclaim in order to protect public health, safety, and property from extreme danger of adverse effects of coal mining practices pre-1977. This can include restoration of land, water, and/or the environment.

As of June 2017, $4.2 million in reclamation work was underway and $63.2 million had been completed across the three priority types.
