* The [Railroad Commission of Texas](http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/) is statutorily responsible for regulating the exploration and production of the state’s natural resources: oil, natural gas, minerals (particularly lignite and coal), and alternative fuels. The commission oversees natural resource extraction, land reclamation, and environmental protection, as well as safety and compliance related to the state’s extensive oil and gas pipeline infrastructure.
