          <p>The federal government issues leases granting rights to explore for natural resources which may exist on federal lands. In return, part of the sales value for many of these commodities is paid back to the government as “royalties” (along with other types of revenues), for the benefit of the American people.</p>

          <p>[This is where information on revenue disbursement will go. The idea will be similar to the current 'bubble graphic' on the beta site, but that interaction tested poorly (people didn't get it) and so we'll be re-working that design in the fall, and adding more data to it, such as disbursements by state and info on the Land and Water Conservation Fund.]</p>

          <!-- <p>The answer is: <strong>it depends</strong>. Laws treat revenues from offshore natural resources and onshore natural resources differently. Laws also treat different commodities differently. For example, for oil and gas, Federal and local governments get royalties that are a percentage of sales. For many minerals such as gold, copper and silver, the governments get mining claim fees but no ongoing royalties.</p> -->
